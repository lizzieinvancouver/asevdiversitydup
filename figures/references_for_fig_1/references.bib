	abstract = {Lime content is the major difference between Northern American and European vine growing soils. This resulted in significant difficulties in the development of rootstocks for European conditions at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. It was only the introduction of Vitis berlandieri as a breeding partner that led to lime-tolerant rootstocks. Despite the importance of V. berlandieri for European viticulture, only a few accessions have so far been exploited for breeding rootstocks. In most cases, these vines were only used because they were available in Europe at that time. The genetic variability of the species is certainly much larger. To preserve and evaluate genetic diversity in V. berlandieri, grape berries from 86 individual vines were collected in September 2005 from a large range of natural stands in Texas, United States. The collection locations were found in 13 counties and across a distribution from N 31° 23’ to N 29° 43’ and W 100° 2’ to W 97° 26’. Vines will be planted in germplasm collections and evaluated for their rooting and grafting ability, their lime tolerance, and other viticultural features. Superior types will then be utilized for rootstock breeding programs.},

	abstract = {Vitis riparia, a critically important Native American grapevine species, is used globally in rootstock and scion breeding and contributed to the recovery of the French wine industry during the mid-19th century phylloxera epidemic. This species has abiotic and biotic stress tolerance and the largest natural geographic distribution of the North American grapevine species. Here we report an Illumina short-read 369X coverage, draft de novo heterozygous genome sequence of V. riparia Michx. ‘Manitoba 37’ with the size of {\textasciitilde}495 Mb for 69,616 scaffolds and a N50 length of 518,740 bp. Using RNAseq data, 40,019 coding sequences were predicted and annotated. Benchmarking with Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis of predicted gene models found 96\% of the complete BUSCOs in this assembly. The assembly continuity and completeness were further validated using V. riparia ESTs, BACs, and three de novo transcriptome assemblies of three different V. riparia genotypes resulting in \&gt;98\% of respective sequences/transcripts mapping with this assembly. Alignment of the V. riparia assembly and predicted CDS with the latest V. vinifera ‘PN40024’ CDS and genome assembly showed 99\% CDS alignment and a high degree of synteny. An analysis of plant transcription factors indicates a high degree of homology with the V. vinifera transcription factors. QTL mapping to V. riparia ‘Manitoba 37’ and V. vinifera PN40024 has identified genetic relationships to phenotypic variation between species. This assembly provides reference sequences, gene models for marker development and understanding V. riparia’s genetic contributions in grape breeding and research.},
