rootstockscionlatlon.csv is a subsample of 100 papers from an ISI search. The goal is mainly to get the lat/lon for where grape rootstock by scion experiments have happened. 

It has the paper ID in the first column. You need to match it to corresponding row number in isi_5May2023.csv, then try to find a full-text copy of the paper from UBC library (be sure to be on the campus wifi and logged into the library) or unpaywall.org and then fill out the following columns:

author: paste from isi_5May2023.csv

year: paste from isi_5May2023.csv

title: paste from isi_5May2023.csv

use: yes or no

ifno_why: if you wrote no, why? Mostly I have found this is because it is not actually a grape paper, so just note the other fruit/crop. If you have another reason, note it briefly. 

where: (optional to fill in) -- if they say where, write it in

lat: latitude of where rootstock x scion experiment happened

lon: longitude of where rootstock x scion experiment happened

how: how you figured out lat/lon; if they gave the lat/lon or a specific location you could find, then leave blank. If you needed to guess at it based on affiliations or such, please note that. 

paper_link: if you find the link to the paper, paste it here, otherwise, leave blank

who: enter your initials for who entered it 

n_scions: (optional to fill in) -- if you can *easily and quickly* grab the number of unique scion varieties, write it in (count varieties, not clones). Scion names you will generally recognize and should be words. 

n_rootstock: (optional to fill in) -- if you can  *easily and quickly* grab the number of unique roostocks, write it in (count varieties, not clones). Rootstock names are varied -- often they are letters and numbers, sometimes words. Some examples: IAC 313, IAC 572, IAC 766, SO4, Paulsen 1103 and Harmony

Geting location data:

When they give the location I put it in google maps and then left-click and copy the first row (lat/long). 

Converting to decimal when needed:
https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/dms-decimal

If you cannot get the full text and so have to guess at the location, that is okay. Just be sure to try to find the full text first. 


You can use the resulting data to update the map (if you want) by running: analyses/maprxsexpts.R
