   The content of pigments and the leaf area per vine were greatest on SO 4
   rootstock On this rootstock, the highest yield was obtained for all

Title = {In vitro selection for tolerance to magnesium deficiency in grapevine
   rootstocks},
Journal = {VITIS},
Year = {1990},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {445},
Abstract = {Some grapevine rootstocks (4453 Malegue, Fercal) are known as very
   susceptible to magnesium deficiency, whether it is induced by low level
   of magnesium in the soil, particularly in acidic soils or, more
   generally, by high levels of potassium fertilization in soils normally
   provided with magnesium. So, their cultivation is strongly hindered in
   many vineyards, despite their other interesting cultural
   characteristics: very high chlorosis resistance for Fercal, drought
   tolerance, low vigor and beneficial effects on wine quality for 44-53
   Malegue. In vitro tissue culture offers new prospects to solve this
   problem. In order to select somaclonal variants of these rootstocks
   exhibiting a lower level of susceptibility to magnesium deficiency, we
   compared the results of in vitro tests made on different varieties known
   as tolerant or susceptible to magnesium deficiency with the behavior of
   these varieties in the vineyard.
   The varieties chosen were 4453 Malegue and Fercal (susceptible), 418 and
   140 Ruggeri (tolerant). Plants were grown for 2 months on culture media
   with different concentrations of magnesium and potassium. Tissues of
   samples constituted of the foliar system (leaf blades, petioles and
   stems) of 6-15 plants (100-300 mg of dry matter) were extracted by HCl
   0.1 N (10 ml for 100 mg of dry matter) and ions K(-), Mg(-) and Ca(-)
   were assayed by flame spectrophotometry.
   An initial experiment was performed using one-node microcuttings and
   micrograftings (scion: Vitis vinifera cv. Syrah) grown on a
   half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with three levels of potassium
   and magnesium fertilization. It shows that the uptake of magnesium by
   vitroplants grown on this medium is not suitable to characterize the
   differences in susceptibility of rootstock varieties to magnesium
   deficiency. Fercal was more susceptible than 41 B (difference slightly
   significant, P = 0.05), 44-53 Malegue appeared curiously more tolerant
   than 140 Ruggeri, but the difference was not significant. The effect of
   grafting was not significant and there wag no interaction between
   variety and grafting.
   A second experiment was performed using one-node microcuttings grown on
   a Galzy medium (modified Knoop 1/2), with a low content in magnesium and
   increasing levels of potassium fertilization (0, 500, 750 and 1000 mg/l
   of KNO(3)). It showed that the uptake of magnesium was significantly (P)
   higher in 140 Ruggeri and 41 B than in Fercal and 44-53 Malegue. The
   inhibitory effect of increasing levels of K(-) on the absorption of
   Mg(-) was clearly demonstrated.
   Somatic embryos of 4453 Malegue were obtained by anther culture and
   selected in conditions of magnesium deficiency After four sub-cultures
   in liquid medium, 37 embryos were retained from which 4 germinated and
   developed into plants. Attempts to obtain somatic embryos by anther
   culture were unsuccessful with the variety Fercal.
   3 selected somaplants of 4453 Malegue (S(1), S(2) and S(4)) were
   compared to an unselected somaplant (T(0)) and the original clone (Cl.
   120). After micropropagation of the somaclones, one-node microcuttings
   and micrograftings (scion: Vitis vinifera cv. Cot) were grown on Galzy
   medium with reduced level of magnesium and two levels of potassium
   fertilization (0 and 1000 mg/l KNO(3)). There were no significant
   differences in the uptake of potassium and calcium between clone and
   somaclones. With low potassium fertilization, the uptake of magnesium by
   somaclone S(2) was significantly lower (P < 0.01). With high potassium
   fertilization, somaclone S, and clone 120 were significantly lower than
   the other somaclones S S T. So, there is evidence or somaclonal
   variation, but it is possible that the occurrence of this variation is
   not linked to the selection pressure applied in vitro. The amplitude of
   this variation is small and its stability and expression need to be
   confirmed in the vineyard. So far, the somaplants have been acclimated
   in the greenhouse and will be planted next year in the field for further
   investigations.},

   .1. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EFFECTS ON GROWTH, CANOPY DEVELOPMENT, YIELD,
   FRUIT-QUALITY AND COLD HARDINESS},
Journal = {VITIS},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Primary (direct) and secondary (indirect) influences of rootstocks on
   vine cold hardiness were determined independently.  Vine size (kg of
   cane prunings per vine) reflects the number of shoots produced per m of
   row and is closely associated with shoot crowding and internal canopy
   shading.  This shading is a secondary rootstock influence.
   Own-rooted Seyval (Sey/own), Seyval grafted to Seyval (Sey/Sey), Kober 5
   BB (Sey/5 BB), and Couderc 3309 (Sey/3309) were the rootstock treatments
   used.  Vine size classes were large (1.82-2.27 kg), medium (1.14-1.59
   kg) and small (0.45-0.91 kg) and were established within each rootstock
   group.
   Rootstock choice had no effect on vine growth and canopy development. 
   Vine productivity was influenced slightly, primarily through differences
   in cluster weight.  By contrast, vine size, regardless of rootstock
   chosen, had a great impact on both vine growth and yield.
   Direct rootstock effects on cold hardiness were assessed via measurement
   of cumulative injury to buds and expressed as shootless nodes.  Cane
   cold hardiness was based on the within-vine distribution of canes with
   differing characteristics associated with hardiness (diameter, exposure
   to sunlight during growth and the development of 5 or more mature
   nodes).
   Both primary and secondary influences of rootstocks on cold hardiness
   were observed.  Bud hardiness was best on scions grafted to Couderc
   3309, and there was a significant graft union effect; Sey/own vines had
   more bud mortality than Sey/Sey vines.  Vine size did not influence the
   percentage of shootless nodes when canes of comparable quality were
   evaluated.  The within-vine distribution of cane quality was influenced,
   however, and large vines had a greater number of both poorly matured and
   canes with superior hardiness status.  By contrast, rootstock did not
   influence the within-vine distribution of cane quality.
   Large vines are not inferior to small vines in the number of best
   quality canes produced and should be equally hardy if careful cane
   selection is practiced at pruning.
   Assessment of the within-vine distribution of canes with superior cold
   hardiness appears to be a useful method of determining secondary
   treatment effects on vine cold hardiness.  This aspect of vine cold
   hardiness should receive greater attention by viti-culture researchers.},

Abstract = {Citrus and grapevines are salt-sensitive perennial crops. Damage caused
   by salinity is due mostly to accumulation of excessive concentrations of
   salt (Na- and Cl ions) in shoot tissues. In both crops, however, some
   rootstock varieties can restrict the accumulation of salt in scion
   leaves and stems. Salt-excluding rootstocks, however, are often
   deficient with regard to other desirable characteristics and as such
   their use is limited. As a consequence, we have conducted a range of
   crosses within both crops to select new salt-excluding hybrids which may
   have potential as new rootstocks and also to investigate the inheritance
   of salt exclusion in these woody perennials.
   In citrus, both Cl-ion and Na-ion exclusion has been observed as a
   continuous character and progenies segregate widely for their ability to
   restrict the accumulation of these ions in shoot tissues. The ability to
   exclude Cl ions appears to be independent of the ability to exclude Na
   ions. Thus a good Cl-ion excluder is not necessarily a good Na-ion
   excluder and vice versa. It has been possible, however, to select new
   salt-excluding citrus hybrids which perform as well as and sometimes
   better than parent varieties when grafted with a common scion and grown
   in artificially salinised field plots.
   In grapevines, the research has concentrated on the ability for Cl-ion
   exclusion and depending on the Cl-ion-excluding parent chosen this is
   inherited as either a polygenic or monogenic trait. In crosses between
   Vitis champini (Cl-ion excluder) and Vitis vinifera (Cl-ion
   accumulator), the ability to restrict Cl-ion accumulation in shoot
   tissues segregates widely with some offspring transgressing the
   performance of either parent. In crosses and backcrosses involving V.
   berlandieri and V. vinifera, however, hybrids segregate as either Cl-ion
   excluders or accumulators suggesting the effect of a major dominant gene
   for Cl-ion exclusion from V. berlandieri. This was evident from both
   field and glasshouse experiments although possible modifying genes from
   V. vinifera may affect the expression of this gene under glasshouse
   conditions in some crosses.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to study the effects of different
   rootstocks on shoot and berry growth of `Fujiminori' grapes. Budbreak,
   shoot growth, development of flower clusters, berry growth, and berry
   quality were investigated in 2 year-old vines grafted on seven different
   rootstocks: 3309, 3306, 101-14, 5C, 8B, SO.4, and 420A. Vines were grown
   in plastic containers in an unheated plastic house.
   Budbreak began earlier and shoot growth was more vigorous on vines
   grafted on 3306, SO.4, and 101-14 compared with those on 420A, 8B, and
   5C stocks. The number of lateral shoots and their lengths were smallest
   on scions grafted on 420A stock.
   More flower clusters per shoot were formed on vines grafted on 420A, 8B,
   and 3306 than were formed on 101-14. Although the number of florets per
   cluster was not significant among shoots on different rootstocks, the
   rate of elongation of panicles in vines grafted on both 101-14 and 5C
   tended to be faster than it was on SO.4 and 420A. No difference was
   observed in the percentage set of berries among the vines grafted on six
   stocks except for 420A, in which the set was significantly higher. Small
   differences in both flowering time and `veraison' were observed among
   the vines grafted on seven stocks. The ratio of seeded berries to total
   berries was higher in vines grafted on SO.4 and 420A stocks than it was
   vines on 8B and 3306 stocks.
   The largest berries were observed in vines grafted on 3306, followed by
   those on 101-14 and 3309, whereas berries on vines grafted on 5C, SO.4,
   and 420A were smallest. The total soluble solids of the juice were
   highest in berries harvested from vines on 3309, SO.4, and 3306 stocks.
   The titratable acidity was relatively low in vines grafted on all
   stocks, especially that on SO.4. Vines grafted on 3306 stock yielded
   berries with the highest level of anthocyanin in the skin; the berries
   from other `Fujiminori' vines were about equally pigmented.},

   While higher rates of A(max) in grafted Orion and Gf.Ga-54-14 vines were
   linked to both higher values of the carboxylation efficiency and of
   stomatal conductance in Riesling and Gf.Ga-47-42 vines, it was
   associated with increases of the carboxylation efficiency but not with
   stomatal conductance. This led to distinctly higher values of the water
   use efficiency of grafted Riesling and Gf.Ga-47-42 vines. Similar
   results were obtained using four-year-old potted vines; Riesling grafted
   to Kober 5BB had significantly higher rates of photosynthesis but
   similar rates of stomatal conductance compared to ungrafted Riesling or
   Riesling grafted to Riesling. Within the first four years the rate of
   photosynthesis of leaves of ungrafted and grafted Riesling vines
   increased more than twofold. It is suggested that grafting vines to

Abstract = {This research is a preliminary report on four rootstock trials on two
   cultivars (Thompson Seedless and Crimson Seedless) at four locations.
   Each location is separated by four to 20 kilometers and represents
   different soil types and grower cultural practices. Rootstock and scion
   wood sources were the same for all locations. The rootstocks, Salt Creek
   (Ramsey), Harmony, Freedom, 039-16, Kober 5BB, Teleki 5C, 1103 Paulsen,
   3309C, 101-14 Mgt, and own root were used in each location. Plots were
   established in 1990 and data collection began in 1993. Harmony and 3309C
   produced the smallest berries in three out of four plots, while own-root
   and 039-16 produced the smallest berries in one plot. The largest
   berries were produced by Salt Creek in all four plots. Packable yields
   followed similar trends. Own root, Harmony, 3309C, 039-16, and Harmony
   (tied with 3309C) exhibited the lowest packable yields in at least one
   location. The rootstocks 039-16, Teleki 5C, Salt Creek (tied with 1103
   Paulsen), and 1103 Paulsen exhibited the highest packable yields in at
   least one location. For Thompson Seedless there was a tendency for 3309C
   to have lower yields and 1103 Paulsen higher yields; 039-16 produced the
   smallest berries in one location, the largest berries in another other.
   Each location is capable of producing meaningful data; however, when
   several locations are compared, variation in rootstock performance
   increases. The results to date support the premise that there will not
   be a single rootstock recommendation for all cultivars. As more data is
   collected, rootstock recommendations could become both site- and
   cultivar-specific.},

Abstract = {In the summer rainfall regions of South Africa, the occurrence of hail
   often results in crop loss. To reduce this risk, table grape producers
   cover vineyards with black hail netting (20\% shading). To compensate
   for the resultant decrease in light and the possible decrease in
   fertility, more stringent control of leaf canopy density was envisaged.
   In this study, the effect of hail netting and the removal of all lateral
   shoots at pea-size were investigated on four Vitis vinifera L. scion
   cultivars grafted onto Jacquez rootstock (Vitis aestivalis Mich. X V.
   cinerea Engel X V. vinifera L.). The following parameters were
   evaluated: phenology, vegetative growth (viz. shoot growth rate,
   internode length, leaf area, and canopy density), canopy microclimate
   (viz. photosynthetic photo flow rate, and air temperature),
   physiological aspects (viz. photosynthetic rate, leaf water potential,
   and transpiration tempo), leaf composition (viz. micro- and macro
   elements, chlorophyll content), grape composition (viz. color intensity,
   sugar concentration and acid concentration), and reproductive growth
   (viz. budding percentage, crop load, and berry set). Results indicate
   that, although vegetative parameters were influenced by hail netting,
   leaf layer number was not affected. Budding percentage and bud fertility
   were adversely affected and berry set decreased. Grape composition
   significantly improved under hail netting, but a delay in harvest was
   induced. The removal of lateral shoots proved to be unsuccessful in
   neutralizing the effect of hail nets. Several negative effects were
   induced by this technique.},

   approximate to 12\% from the overall mean. Among the healthy trees, VE
   densities and diameters were similar for the trees on CC or RT, and
   larger than those for trees on SO or CM. VEs were generally smaller and
   at lower densities in the scion than the rootstock. Few VE occlusions

Abstract = {Dormant cuttings from grapevine source areas in three Australian states
   were indexed for the presence of Agrobacterium vitis, the causal agent
   of crown gall disease of grapevine. The bacterium was present at varying
   levels in both rootstock and scion material from New South Wales,
   Victoria, and Western Australia. A genomic DNA fingerprinting technique
   was used to compare these strains of A. vitis with strains previously
   isolated from South Australian propagation material and with strains
   from the United States of America, particularly strains from the
   University of California at Davis where a number of Australian grape
   cultivars originated. Nine distinct DNA fingerprint types were found,
   demonstrating that A. vitis is a genetically heterogeneous species.
   There were no DNA fingerprint types in common between Australian states,
   suggesting that little or no transfer of A, vitis between states has
   occurred. Two Californian strains were indistinguishable, when analysed
   by DNA fingerprinting, from strains isolated over a 14 year period in
   South Australia. This finding is strong circumstantial evidence that A.
   vitis was introduced to South Australia on grapevine cuttings imported
   from California. Given the fact that A. vitis is probably not indigenous
   to Australia, it is possible that the different strains found in each
   state were the result of independent introductions. Although grapevines
   from all Australian states tested did contain A. vitis, the existence of
   unique strains in each state means that the restrictions on movement of
   grapevine material between states should be maintained, and that
   quarantine authorities should avoid introducing further strains of the
   bacterium.},

Abstract = {Clonal selection commenced at Geisenheim in 1921. Due to the long
   tradition of grape growing and the presence of Xiphinema index, fanleaf,
   and other virus diseases low productivity was common. Focusing selection
   on the genetic improvement of traditional German varieties resulted in a
   major reduction in the occurrence of grapevine fanleaf and leafroll
   disease. The effectiveness of these selection methods in eradicating the
   economically important virus infections was demonstrated in the late
   1960s, when indexing became available as a breeder's tool for virus
   detection. From the mid-1980s, ELISA techniques were increasingly
   adapted for monitoring the disease status of Geisenheim clones and
   varieties. Today, virus tests are conducted at every propagation step,
   effectively preventing the multiplication of fanleaf- and
   leafroll-infected bud Mood. To prevent gene erosion, Geisenheim breeders
   tried to maintain the genetic range within varieties by selecting a
   large number of different clones of each variety and commenced clonal
   selection on minor varieties to prevent their extinction. Today,
   Geisenheim has 73 clones of 10 scion varieties and 32 clones of nine
   rootstock varieties registered. Two hundred hectares of scion and about
   200 hectares of rootsrock mother blocks are under permanent supervision.
   The effectiveness and value of clonal selection even today is
   demonstrated by the variety Blauer Fruhburgunder (Pinot noir precoce).
   The wine of this variety has long been mythical among German winemakers
   and is considered as superior to that of Pinot noir, but wide-spread
   virus infections and a low genetic yield potential of less than 2.5 t/ha
   virtually wiped out this variety. Clonal selection could eradicate the
   virus-infected material and produce clones with an average yield of 8 to
   9 t/ha, without reducing the wine quality.},

Abstract = {With the objective of screening a great number of grapevine varieties
   for their resistance to virus diseases, we looked for the most
   appropriate technique of inoculation. As the mechanical inoculation of a
   virus to the grapevine succeeds only under special conditions, we
   compared different grafting techniques: dormant grafting and green
   grafting, the last with and without previously rooted rootstock. For
   each of these three methods, the inoculum was used as the stock on one
   hand, as the scion on the other hand. This study proved that the dormant
   grafting technique using the inoculum as the rootstock is the most
   efficient technique. Nevertheless, good results were obtained by using
   the green grafting technique without previously rooting the rootstock,
   the inoculum being also used as the rootstock. As the green grafting
   method doesn't require a great area, is not time-consuming and can be
   performed throughout the year, it seems therefore to be a very
   convenient method of inoculating a great number of varieties.},

Abstract = {A portable infra-red gas analyzer system was used to measure net
   photosynthetic rates on individual leaves of field-grown Vitis vinifera
   L. plants. Generally, the leaf opposite to the upper cluster or all
   leaves of an average shoot were measured between 10:00 and 12:00. In
   Pinot noir (clone M 1/17) planted in 1985, there was a significant
   effect of training system early in the season: photosynthesis of
   high-trained cordon pruned vines nas 27\% lower than of low-trained
   either cane or cordon pruned vines. However this effect disappeared
   later in the season. Leaf position within the canopy and, therewith.
   light availability on individual leaves became the predominant factor
   affecting photosynthetic rates, although the highest assimilation rates
   were measured in the middle part of the shoot and decreasing rates
   towards both the basal (source) and apical (sink) leaves.
   When 3 leaves were removed in the cluster zone of Pinot noir vines 3
   weeks after bloom. photosynthesis of the remaining leaves increased as
   compared to the removal of 6 or 12 leaves. Six weeks after leaf removal
   net assimilation rates started to decrease. This decrease was, however,
   the stronger the less leaves had been removed, indicating a delay in
   senescence of the remaining leaves after defoliation. If the lateral
   shoots were consistently removed during the season. the main-shoot
   leaves responded by increasing their photosynthetic rates during the
   rest of the season and by a delay in senescence.
   In Muller-Thurgau grapevines on 5C planted in 1988, with either 2
   (control). 1 or 0 grape clusters after either carl! or late cluster
   thinning, no significant effect of crop load could be detected on leaf
   gas exchange. Nevertheless. there was a clear trend towards higher
   photosynthetic rates in the control vines during the entire season.
   Leaves in the upper part of the shoot (number 10 from the base) always
   assimilated at a higher rate than leaves in the cluster zone (number 4
   from the base). The difference increased from 5\% at bloom time to 65\%
   at han cst.
   Rootstocks markedly affected net assimilation rates of scion leaves in
   Muller-Thurgau planted in 1986. and there was a significant interaction
   with nitrogen fertilization. Generally, 100 kg N/ha increased leaf gas
   exchange compared to non-fertilization. However. this increase was minor
   in vines on 3309 and Ru 140, intermediate in vines on 5BB. 5C and 8B,
   and large in vines on SO4. In unfertilized vines the highest
   photosynthetic rates were found on 5BB, which were similar to the
   average of all rootstocks in the fertilized vines. On the other hand,
   the lowest rates in the unfertilized plants were measured on SO4,
   whereas this rootstock led to the highest rates in the fertilized vines.
   These results indicate that training systems should be designed to
   maximize the leaf area directly exposed to incident sunlight rather than
   maximizing the total leaf area. They also emphasize the importance of
   young, actively assimilating leaves late in the season for quality wine
   grape production. as well as the effect of sink demand on source
   productivity. In addition-interacting effects have been shown of
   rootstock and nitrogen availability indicating that rootstocks should be
   chosen according to soil fertility, in order to avoid unnecessary
   fertilization.},

Abstract = {Gruener Veltliner is a proper cultivar for cool-climate-viticulture and
   widely spread in Austria. Previous results revealed that vintage data
   were not sufficient for evaluations of rootstock effects. Investigations
   in rootstock-scion interactions during ripening progress showed
   significant effects on berry compounds due to the genetic origin of the
   rootstocks: amount and progress of sugar accumulation, decrease of
   titratable acidity, ratio of malic and tartaric acids, potassium
   concentration and finally the acceptance of nines. In comparison with
   the V.berlandieri x V.riparia rootstocks (5C, 5BB, SO4) the
   V.rupestris-based Ruggeri 140 caused a quick start of sugar
   accumulation, but during endripening a slow further accumulation. So the
   V.berl. x V.rip. rootstocks gave rise to better must density at last.
   Additionally potassium decreased in a significant way after a maximum
   during veraison. Sensory and analytical evaluations of wines revealed a
   significant positive correlation between acceptance of wines and their
   K+ concentration. So the following recommendations for optimizing wine
   grape quality of the cultivar Gruener Veltliner resulted from the
   investigations: Gruener Veltliner grafted onto Ru 140 is early ripening
   with sufficient compounds of juice, and so well suited for late sites.
   In good ! years however, vintage must not be delayed to prevent poor
   vines caused by deficiency of potassium. If Gruener Veltliner is grafted
   onto V.ber. x V.rip. rootstocks vintage can be delayed until the
   decrease of titratable acidity will draw the line. For optimizing wine
   quality, the rootstocks have to be chosen in accordance to the sites,
   and the moment of vintage must be chosen in accordance to the year's
   climate and the specific effects of rootstocks.},

Abstract = {Despite the great economic importance of citrus, its phylogeny and
   taxonomy remain a matter of controversy. Moreover pathogens of increased
   virulence and dramatic environmental changes are currently spreading or
   emerging. The objectives of the present paper, measuring genetic
   variability and studying its pattern of distribution, are crucial steps
   to optimize sampling strategies in the search of genotypes that tolerate
   or resist these threatening factors within the huge array of Citrus and
   Citrus related species. Their intraspecific and intrageneric variability
   was studied comparatively by means of ten enzymatic systems using eight
   different measures. The analysis of ten enzymatic systems allowed us to
   distinguish all the species and all but one artificial hybrid. The
   species with the lowest genotypic variability are C. myrtifolia, C.
   deliciosa (willow leaf mandarin), C. paradisi (grapefruit), C. limon
   (lemon) and C. sinensis (sweet orange), while Severinia buxifolia shows
   the highest value. A broad spectrum of heterozygosity values was found
   in the collection. Lemons (C. limon, C. meyeri, C. karna, C.
   volkameriana), limes (C. aurantifolia, C. limettioides, C. lattifolia)
   and C. bergamia show a very high percentage of heterozygosity which
   indicates an origin through interspecific hybridization. Two main
   factors limit genetic intraspecific variability: apomictic reproduction:
   where nucellar embryos are much more vigorous than the zygotic ones, and
   nursery-men selecting against variability in the seedling stage of the
   rootstocks or in propagating the scion cultivars vegetatively.
   Additionally, self-pollination appears in some species mainly used as
   rootstocks which would explain their low heterozygosity values. Genetic
   differences between species and genera are in general high, which
   suggests that adaptation might have played an important role during the
   evolution of the orange subfamily.},

Abstract = {In spite of their efficiency, sanitary and genetic selection methods
   require a long period of time, particularly for local grapevine
   varieties. When perfectly performed, micrografting might be a rapid
   selection method; however, apices taken from field plants did not
   improve the percentage of successful grafts more than 10-15\%. Such
   failures were directly related to the higher incidence of browning and
   drying apices. On the other hand, use of sand media or in vitro
   techniques did not improve results with micrografting. To overcome these
   constraints, pretreatments of the scion apex as well as the rootstock
   were considered necessary. Given the necessity for pretreatment, our
   results (Ben Abdallah et al., 1996) have shown a significant improvement
   in grafting success (57\%). An alternative method is to use higher
   concentrations of MgSO4 (450 mg/L), and Fe-EDTA (40 mg/L) supplemented
   with benzylaminopyrine (BAP; 2mg/L) and naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA; 0.1
   mg/L). Accordingly, we obtained a high graft take (63\%) by using
   rockwool-grown seedlings as rootstocks.
   The placement of the apex on the outward cortical surface of the
   hypocotyl plays a significant role in increasing success and reducing by
   35 to 36\% the incidence of browning and drying of apices. The technique
   was applied to three local varieties adapted to dry and salt conditions
   that are of economic and agronomic importance.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, grapevine varieties are identified by morphological
   characteristics, e.g. leaf shape and size, type and density of hairs on
   shoot tips and leaves. This method depends both on green shoots and in
   many cases on specific stages of plant development. Furthermore also
   environmental factors affect morphological characteristics of plants. To
   become independent of environmental influence and plant development,
   molecular biological techniques e.g. RFLP and RAPD/PCR were soon adapted
   to grapevines. Most previous studies on grapevine identification dealt
   with scion varieties, whereas publications on rootstocks are quite rare.
   Rootstocks, treated as disbudded material, do not have enough
   morphological characteristics for variety identification. Therefore the
   aim of this study was to develop a procedure to identify rootstock
   varieties from dormant cuttings. During these investigations a method
   for DNA-extraction from one-year old grapevine cuttings was developed by
   adapting LODHI's DNA-extraction procedure. This modified method allows a
   fast reliable and inexpensive DNA-extraction. It yields good DNA quality
   and purity. DNA, extracted by this procedure, was amplified by RAPD/PCR
   reaction and fractionated on an agarose-gel. Overall 48 RAPD (random
   amplified polymorphic DNA) -primers were tested to find polymorphisms
   useful for the identification of the seven most common rootstock
   varieties in Germany (Teleki 8B, Kober 125AA, Kober 5BB, 5C Geisenheim,
   SO4, 3309C and Boerner). It proved to be possible to distinguish all
   seven rootstocks using two primers only. Therefore the method is
   suitable for routine variety determination of dormant cuttings.},

   vectored by the dagger nematode, Xiphinema index, remains one of the
   world's most serious grape diseases. The disease affects berry set and
   can result in yield reductions of 80\% or greater. There are few control
   measures. Nematicides and fumigants have not proven effective and
   further development of these pesticides is limited by concerns of ground
   water contamination and environmental toxicity. Development of
   rootstocks capable of resisting X. index feeding has been underway at
   the University of California, Davis since the 1970s, and a Vitis
   vinifera x Muscadinia rotundifolia hybrid, 039-16, was released: This'
   rootstock is limited by its potential phylloxera susceptibility,
   susceptibility to root-knot nematodes, and induction of high vigor to
   the scion. Vitis rupestris x M. rotundifolia hybrids were bred with
   strong resistance to X index. A revised screening technique found a very
   high correlation between feeding damage and nematode numbers. Sixty of
   the 200 seedlings tested were resistant, and a RAPD marker produced by
   the Operon primer OPA-12 was found to be tightly linked to resistance.
   Two of these seedlings 8913-02 and 8913-21 are highly resistant to X:
   index, several very aggressive strains of root-knot nematode, and
   phylloxera. Field trials with these and other V. rupestris x M.
   rotundifolia hybrids are in place and are designed to test the
   durability of their resistance and evaluate their viticultural
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {Since its first appearance in Europe in 1863 phylloxera has been a major
   threat to European viticulture. Phylloxera tolerant rootstock varieties
   are since then used to control this pest. During recent years phylloxera
   damages occurred even in grafted vineyards in California and Germany.
   The rootstock variety `Borner' (Na 5153-54) appears to be able to
   overcome these problems. It is a cross between Vitis riparia and the
   completely phylloxera resistant Vitis cinerea Arnold. So far it has
   demonstrated a high resistance against all strains of phylloxera,
   available for testing. It has a grafting affinity similar to commonly
   used Berlandieri x Riparia rootstocks and shows a good adaptation to a
   wide range of soil types. The performance of Riesling as scion grafted
   on `Borner' is similar or better than that of commonly used rootstocks
   in Germany and in particular under dry conditions. The only problems
   encountered so far are iron chlorosis on extremely wet, heavy, water
   logged soils and moderate rooting under certain conditions.},

Abstract = {A greenhouse bioassay technique for the diagnosis of not yet
   characterized grapevine virus-similar diseases is proposed as an
   alternative to woody-grafting, green-grafting or micrografting.
   The assay tested the presence of vein necrosis on clones of rootstocks
   101-14 C., Schwarzmann and of cv Pinot gris, which, in comparison with a
   healthy clone of Chardonnay, resulted infected with the traditional
   woody procedures. It requires micropropagated and acclimatised indicator
   plants for green-grafting with leaf petiole or secondary shoot from
   plants in field as scion. At the end of June, the material was manually
   green-grafted on the predisposed indicator plants, which were pruned to
   two buds for the development of possible symptoms. The graft unions were
   protected with a strip of parafilm. The plants were kept in a greenhouse
   under mist for 15 days. The controls were carried out after 40 days: the
   first symptoms were visible on the upper and lower surfaces of median
   and basal leaves of the indicator plant. Best results were seemingly
   obtained by using secondary shoots of infected vines for the rootstocks
   and leaf petioles for cv of V. vinifera L. This technique could be a
   simpler and faster alternative bioassay. It has the advantage to use
   test material (leaves or secondary shoots) available during the whole
   growing season and always of the right size with respect to the
   indicator plant.},

Abstract = {The effects of two grapevine rootstocks on susceptibility of grafted
   scions to crown gall (Agrobacterium vitis and Agrobacterium tumefaciens)
   was investigated in greenhouse and field experiments. The incidence of
   crown gall on a susceptible grape scion cultivar (Vitis vinifera, cv.
   Kiralyleanyka) was not affected by grafting it on a crown gall resistant
   rootstock (Vitis riparia, cv. Gloire) or on a susceptible rootstock
   (V.berlandieri x V.riparia, cv. Teleki 5C) when the inoculated vines
   were observed over a 2-month period in the greenhouse. Weights of galls
   that were induced by six of eight strains of Agrobacterium (six A.vitis
   and two A.tumefaciens) were not significantly different, but
   A.tumefaciens strain 16/6 and A.vitis strain 2/3 produced significantly
   larger galls on Kiralyleanyka vines that were growing on their own roots
   or were grafted on SC than on those grafted on Gloire. When the same
   vines were planted in the field and observed over a 4-year period, no
   differences in incidence of crown gall were apparent until the third and
   fourth years, when vines grafted on Gloire had less crown gall than
   vines on 5C. By that time, the natural symptoms (galls along the trunk)
   of the disease appeared, coinciding with the decline of whole vines. In
   another field experiment, with naturally infected scions of V.vinifera,
   cv. Blau Frankisch (susceptible), crown gall was apparent on vines
   grafted on both rootstocks after 2 years, but in the fifth year 79 \% of
   the vines on SC had crown gall whereas only 9\% on Gloire showed
   symptoms. After the appearance of typical natural symptoms, vines showed
   reduced vigor with substantial loss of trunks and entire vines. During
   this period, many vines on 5C died as compared with only a few on
   Gloire. By the end of the sixth year, 13 \% of the originally planted
   vines on 5C and 82\% on Gloire were alive, and although many pathogenic
   strains of Agrobacterium spp. were isolated from the roots of 5C, none
   was isolated from Gloire.},

   trials with natural pathogen inoculum, application of either B-4117 or
   CR330D significantly reduced the incidence and severity of crown gall
   caused by A. tumefaciens on grapeville and raspberry. The extent of
   disease control depended upon the variety tested. Both bacteria reduced
   disease during seedling root production and grafting. The disease
   incidence on root cuttings of three grapevine varieties was reduced by
   56-80\% and the disease severity index (DSI) was decreased by 75-86\%.
   Depending on the scion variety, the number of healthy rooted grafts
   increased by 2-3.5-fold, while the DSI was reduced by 1.5-3-fold. The
   results suggest that there is potential in using these antagonists to
   diminish the influence of latent rootstock infection on graft
   sensitivity to crown gall. Pretreatment of rooted raspberry seedlings

Abstract = {In order to investigate the effects of rootstocks on plants of the genus
   Vitis subjected to gradually increased levels of water stress we studied
   the links between abscisic acid in leaves and the major leaf
   physiological parameters. Cuttings of Vitis vinifera cv. Muller Thurgau
   were grafted onto three hybrid rootstocks (H1, H8, H26) and grown in
   pots. Own-rooted plants of V. vinifera and own-rooted hybrids were also
   cultivated in an identical manner. Vines were tested during 7 and 14
   days of water stress (i.e. daily water supply reduced to 66\% of
   well-watered plants). Water stress reduced net photosynthesis and
   stomatal conductance with large differences between grafted and
   ungrafted vines. Significant differences were observed after only 14
   days of water stress. In particular two grafting combinations, V.
   vinifera grafted on H1 (V/H1) and H8 (V/H8), did not show net
   photosynthesis reduction after 14 days of water stress. Water use
   efficiency increased with water stress whereas carboxylation efficiency
   was reduced. Net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and carboxylation
   efficiency were affected by the rootstock genotype combination, so that
   under water stress only some rootstock genotypes transferred drought
   tolerance to the scion. Abscisic acid in leaves increased significantly
   from Control to 7 and 14 days of water stress but the relations with CO2
   assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and carboxylation efficiency
   appeared to be affected by the genotype of the vegetative apparatus. Our
   data show that the interaction between scion and rootstock with regard
   to production performance under water deficits may be an important
   consideration in vineyard planting strategies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {In a three years field experiment with Vitis vinifera grown up in

   an alkaline top layer with high sodium, boron and heavy metal content
   (municipal solid waste incinerator bottom slag) on the uptake and
   translocation of these elements from roots developing in this layer to
   leaves and downward translocation to roots in the bottom layer (Keuper
   or Loess) were studied. Control plants and slag treated vine plants
   exhibited a similar pattern of composition in respect to main elements
   such as N, S, P, Mg, K, indicating an acceptable nutrition status in the
   presence of a top slag layer, except that leaves of slag plants showed
   slight symptoms of phosphate deficiency. The high sodium concentration
   in the alkaline top layer caused a significant increase of the sodium
   content in the roots developing in this layer and to a lesser extent in
   the roots of the bottom layer. However, no increase was observed in the
   sodium content of leaves demonstrating sodium exclusion from vine
   leaves. The heavy metal burden of the alkaline top layer caused a strong
   increase of lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, and chromium contents of the
   roots of this layer. The corresponding values for roots in the bottom
   layer were much lower and no significant differences between control and
   slag treated plants were observed. Similar applied to the leaves, the
   heavy metal contents of which were significantly lower than that of the
   roots of the bottom layer. Thus also heavy metals are largely excluded
   from the transport from the rootstock to the scions. The only element
   exhibiting a large transfer from the polluted alkaline top layer to the
   vine leaves and roots in the bottom layer was boron. This element
   accumulated in all organs of the vine plants treated with slag,
   particular in the leaves, where its concentration went up almost close
   to limits of phytotoxicity. Data are discussed in respect to potential
   hazards of municipal waste incinerator bottom slag to the environment if

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {343-355},
Abstract = {Mature field-grown grapevines, Colombard on Ramsey rootstock, grown in a
   semi-arid climate were irrigated with saline water during any one of 4
   growth stages within the season: pre-flowering, during berry
   development, during berry ripening, and post-harvest. At other times,
   plots were irrigated with river water (EC 0.5 dS/m) as was the control
   throughout the season. Saline water (EC 3.5 dS/m) with a high sodium
   absorption ratio was produced by addition of sodium chloride brine. Soil
   cation exchange capacity was 14 cmol(c)/kg, and at the end of the trial,
   the soil exchangeable sodium percentage in the control was 6\%, in the
   treatment salinised pre-flowering 13\%, during berry development 20\%,
   during berry ripening 20\%, and post-harvest 19\%. Treatments were
   applied for 6 consecutive seasons. Vines were highly productive, with
   the average yield in the control equal to 62 t/ha of grapes. Saline
   irrigation caused significant, but small, declines in yield in 3
   seasons, in pruning weights in 2 seasons, and in berry weights in 4
   seasons. Effects on growth, once established, often persisted unchanged
   through one or more subsequent seasons of saline irrigation. The growth
   stage shown to be most sensitive to saline irrigation was berry
   development; saline irrigation during berry development reduced the
   yield by 7\% and during berry ripening by 3\%, and pre-flowering it
   reduced the berry weight by 1\%, during berry development by 6\%, and
   during berry ripening by 4\%. The amounts of irrigation applied in each
   of the 4 growth stages were not equal, and hence, treatments did not
   receive equal additions of salt. Normalising data to remove this effect
   showed that the rate of yield decline per unit dS/m increase in the
   seasonal average salinity during berry development, 7\%/dS.m, was 3-fold
   greater than the 2\%/dS.m during berry ripening. We conclude that this
   scion/rootstock combination, grown under these conditions, can maintain
   high productivity despite `slugs' of saline irrigation.},

   stem water potential values (Psi(stem)) did not differ among the
   treatments. Net carbon dioxide assimilation (A), stomatal conductance
   (g(s)), and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE) were influenced by
   treatment, and behaved similarly comparing the two years. Carignane
   vines had significantly greater gas exchange values than either V.
   riparia or the grafted vines, but the latter two were similar to one

   the present study we give account of leaves originated from vines grown
   same soil type and nutrient condition. Statistically significant
   differences were found in the yield production and Ca concentration of
   scion leaf blades according to the rootstocks as well according to the
   scions also. After the first yield production year the differences in K
   and Ca contents of the leaves were greater by the scion varieties than
   the rootstocks. The highest Ca concentrations were determined at the
   scion leaves with combination of Georgikon 28 \{(V. berlandieri x V.
   riparia T. K. 5BB) x V. vinifera\} rootstock. The differences in Ca
   concentrations were higher according to the scion varieties. It shows
   not only the rootstocks or the scions influences the nutrient supply of
   the vines, but the combinations of these two components is very
   important from this point of view.},

Abstract = {The effect of nitrate and chloride on the ion transport of rootstock
   varieties (Fercal, Rupestris du Lot, Georgikon 28) and a scion Kahet was
   examined with 25 mM Ca(NO3)(2) or Ca(Cl)(2) treatment of rooted one node
   cuttings grown in 1/10 Hoagland solution. Roots and leaves were analysed
   for water extractable fraction of anions (NO3-, Cl-, HPO42-, SO42-, HPLC
   method) and cations (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ Na+; AAS method). Varietal
   differences in anion content of the roots were significant: 5-10 times
   higher anion levels were measured in Georgikon 28 and Rupestris du Lot
   than in Kahet and Fercal and this difference was smaller in the leaf
   blades. Cl- was the most mobile anion in the plants reflected by the
   high Cl- level of the roots and leaves in Cl- treatments. Two different
   defending mechanisms can be distinguished on the basis of Cl- content of
   the roots: Cl- accumulation (Georgikon 28 and Rupestris du Lot, 2331 and
   1845 mu mol/g dw. Cl- respectively) and Cl- exclusion (Kahet and Fercal,
   230 and 518 mu mol/gdw. Cl-).. A mutual interference of Cl- and NO3-
   ions could be observed. Elevated level (50 mM) of Cl- or NO3- in the
   nutrient solution inhibited the transport of the other anion to a large
   extent. In Cl- treatments the NO3- concentration of the roots was
   decreased to 30-60 \% of the NO3- content of the control plants. In the
   presence of 50 mM NO3-, Cl- was not found in the roots of Rupestris du
   Lot and Georgikon 28 and in Kahet and Fercal the low control Cl- level
   was slightly affected. In 25 mM Ca(Cl)(2) treatments the intensive Cl-
   transport was accompanied by the increase of the water soluble K+, Ca2+
   and Mg2+ concentration in the leaves.},

Abstract = {Citrus genetic improvement through conventional methods is greatly
   hindered by nucellar polyembryony, pollen and/or ovule sterility, and
   wide incompatibility. Protoplast fusion is an alternative that can be
   used to circumvent these difficulties and efficiently transfer
   resistances to biotic and abiotic stress to commercial scion cultivars
   and rootstocks. More than 20 interspecific, intergeneric, and
   intertribal somatic hybrids have recently been obtained in our program
   by electrically induced fusion. The hybrids include those from elite
   scion cultivars such as Bonanza navel orange + Red blush grapefruit,
   Newhall navel orange + Eureka lemon. Newhall navel + Kuigan, Kinnow +
   Bendizao tangerine, and those from complementary rootstocks such as red
   tangerine + trifoliate orange, red tangerine + rough lemon, red
   tangerine + citrange. Fusion between Citrus and its wild relatives such
   as Page tangelo + Murraya paniculata and C. sinensis + Clausena lansium
   (6x) regenerated allo-tetraploid and allo-hexaploid plants respectively.
   By standard symmetric fusion, diploid mesophyll parent type plants
   (putative cybrids) from more than ten combinations were also
   regenerated. To verify their hybridity, all the regenerants were
   identified by morphology, cytology, isozyme analysis and random
   amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Further identification by
   restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and horticultural
   evaluation is in progress.},

Abstract = {Vineyards in Germany are mostly planted on Vitis berlandieri x Vitis
   riparia rootstocks. At these rootstocks Phylloxera can feed only on root
   tips causing root galls called nodosities. Any feeding on mature root,
   causing tuberosities, could not be observed. The effects of Phylloxera
   infection on water relationships of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) were
   investigated in a pot experiment at the Institut for Grapevine Breeding
   and Grafting, Geisenheim (Germany).
   The rootstock used was 5 C (Vitis berlandieri x Vitis riparia), the
   scions were White Riesling and Pinot gris (Rulander). During the growing
   season 1998, the effect of root damage, caused by Phylloxera, on leaf
   area development and water consumption was studied on adequately watered
   plants, growing in 30 L pots.
   Water consumption of infested and non-infested vines was studied by sap
   flow measurement according to Granier. The Granier method allows a
   continuous measurement of the transpiration of the whole plant in the
   field.
   Transpiration was measured over a period of 66 days, starring on July
   19, 1998 on three vines in each treatment. The mean cumulative sap flow
   of these three plants over the entire measurement period was expressed
   as sap now per unit leaf area. The transpiration rate, expressed in
   litres per m(2) leaf area, did not show any differences between infested
   and non infested vines. It can be concluded, that the presence of even
   high numbers of nodosities had no influence at the transpiration of the
   vine, if water supply was adequate.},

Abstract = {The influence on water relations of two training systems - Silvoz and
   minimal pruning was examined on field grown grapevines (Vitis vinifera
   L. c.v. White Riesling clone 198 Gm scion), grafted on 5 C Geisenheim
   clone 6-13 Gm rootstocks. Crops were planted in 1977 at the Research
   Institute in Geisenheim, Germany (50 degrees North, 8 degrees East). One
   part of the experimental plot was irrigated by drip irrigation, the
   other part was without irrigation. Canopy leaf areas from Silvoz-trained
   vertical shoot positioned vines (VSP) ranged from 3.2 to 5.9 m(2),
   whereas the canopy leaf area from minimal pruned vines ranged from 8.6
   to 11.4 m(2).
   Pre-dawn leaf water potential was measured weekly during the growing
   period. The water consumption of grapevines was measured by a modified
   Granier system. This method allows a continuous measurement of sap flow
   through the stem under natural conditions in the field. Measurements
   were carried out over a 4 month period in 1998. Data obtained from sap
   flow sensors showed differences in transpiration rates caused by
   different canopy sizes and varying evaporative demands as a result of
   changing meteorological conditions. During a period of 130 days the
   average water use of minimally pruned vines reached 372 litres per
   plant, while water consumption of VSP-vines was 282 litres per vine.},

Abstract = {Citrus germplasm sources utilized as rootstocks differ substantially in
   their susceptibility to salinity. The main difference seems to be in the
   ability to absorb chloride and sodium from the soil and/or the ability
   to translocate the harmful ions to the scion. Grafted, field grown trees
   may behave differently from potted trees. However, constructing a
   traditional field experiment involves the use of many border trees,
   rendering such experiments expensive and thus rare. A field experiment
   was constructed using trickle linear-gradient salinity (TLG). `Marsh'
   Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) were grafted on 10 different citrus
   rootstocks, planted in the Northern Negev, Israel. The experimental
   orchard was drip irrigated with reclaimed water and subjected to an
   additional linear salinity gradient (TLG) along the rows. The TLG setup
   enabled us to construct a major factorial field experiment without
   border trees, and differences between the rootstocks were significant

Abstract = {The pH of grape juice or wine is a the major quality factor. Research
   has demonstrated that rootstocks can affect grape juice pH by changing
   grape juice K+ concentration. Field and glasshouse studies indicated
   that this effect of rootstocks on scion grape juice pH and K+ levels
   originate from different K+ uptake rates of rootstock varieties. At
   least with the varieties tested, these genotypic differences in K+
   uptake only occurred at high levels of K+ supply, and not at low levels
   of K+ supply. This indicates that as in the roots of most other plant
   species. a dual K+ uptake mechanism exists in roots of grapevines, and
   that only the mechanism operational at high K+ levels is different in
   the rootstock varieties studied. It therefore appears feasible to breed
   rootstock varieties, which combine high K+ efficiency at low K+ supply
   with restricted K+ uptake at high supply. This model is currently being
   verified under German conditions on a range of rootstock varieties.},

Abstract = {Scions from two mature `Pione' vines, which bore well-colored berries
   (vines A and B, superior berry color, SEC) and two with poorly colored
   ones (vines C and D, inferior berry color, IBC) annually, were grafted
   on Teleki 5BB rootstocks. The vines of the two strains were then planted
   in the same vineyard. Shoot growth and berry development on each vine
   were recorded throughout the growing season. The partitioning of
   C-13-photosynthates from leaves into the various parts of the shoot of
   the two strains, which were exposed to (CO2)-C-13 at two weeks after
   veraison, was investigated. No significant differences in shoot
   elongation, increment of leaf area per shoot, and changes in chlorophyll
   content of leaves between the two strains were observed. No notable
   difference in berry enlargement between the two strains was observed,
   although the berries at harvest from vines B and D were significantly
   heavier than those from vines A and C. The total soluble solids contents
   of the juice and anthocyanin levels of the skins were higher in berries
   from SEC vines than in those from IBC vines throughout the ripening
   stage; they increased significantly in the SEC vines two to three weeks
   after veraison. At harvest, anthocyanin content in the berry skins from
   vines of SEC was two to three times higher than in those from vines of
   IBC. At the end of (CO2)-C-13 feeding, the leaves on the main shoot of
   the SEC vines contained significantly more C-13 label than those of the
   IBC vines. 13C concentration in leaves on both main and lateral shoots
   on all vines decreased rapidly for 24 hr after feeding followed by a
   gradual decrease, whereas it increased in berries with time. At 72 hr
   and 120 hr after feeding, C-13-photosynthates were translocated into
   berries larger in SEC vines than those in IBC vines. At 120 hr after
   feeding, the distribution ratio of C-13-photosynthates in the berries
   was higher in SEC vines than in IBC vines, while it was the reverse in
   the leaves on the main shoot. The relationship between translocation and
   partitioning of photosynthates and the accumulation of sugar and
   anthocyanin in berries, which differed between vines of the two strains,
   is discussed.},

Abstract = {Increasing losses of trees to diseases, expansion of plantings into more
   marginal production areas and the need to control tree size to reduce
   harvesting costs have elevated the demand for new improved citrus
   rootstocks in Florida. A major strategy of the CREC rootstock
   improvement programme has been to use protoplast fusion to produce
   allotetraploid somatic hybrids that combine complementary rootstock
   germplasm. Tetraploid citrus rootstocks have been shown to have a
   built-in tree size control component due to polyploidy. This report
   focuses on the incorporation of newly identified superior rootstock
   germplasm into the somatic hybridization programme. Poncirus trifoliata
   50-7, a selection of trifoliate orange selected for superior resistance
   to Phytophthora nicotianae, was hybridized with sour orange, Changsha
   mandarin, Navel orange, and a seedy white `Duncan' type grapefruit.
   High-yielding Benton citrange (Citrus sinensis X Poncirus trifoliata)
   was hybridized with Changsha mandarin and sour orange. More than 200
   plants of each of these six new somatic hybrids were propagated via
   tissue culture and rooted cuttings. To assess their horticultural
   performance, all the somatic hybrids were budded with commercially
   important scions and planted in replicated trials representing the two
   most important soil types in Florida. Seed trees of each somatic hybrid
   have also been planted in the fit ld to determine fruiting potential and
   level of polyembryony.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the response to nitrogen (0 or 100 kg N/ha) of

   the end of flowering. Glutamine accounted for over 85\% of xylem
   nitrogen, indicating that most soil nitrogen was assimilated by way of
   vine root metabolism. Nitrogen supply increased the translocation of
   glutamine, glutamate, NO3-, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and PO43- in the xylem
   sap and decreased the ratio of organic to inorganic nitrogen, V.
   berlandieri x V. riparia crosses generally resulted in higher xylem
   solute concentrations compared with other rootstocks, but were less
   effective in total nitrogen assimilation. High soil nitrogen increased
   vine leaf area by stimulating lateral-shoot growth, increased leaf
   chlorophyll, photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance, and
   delayed leaf senescence. There was no difference among rootstocks in
   scion leaf area, but rootstocks affected scion response to soil nitrogen
   level in terms of leaf chlorophyll content and leaf gas exchange; SO4
   induced the strongest reaction to soil N, whereas Ru-140 elicited the
   least reaction. Chlorophyll content was highest for vines grafted on 5BB
   and lowest for C-3309. Photosynthesis response to both nitrogen and
   rootstock was regulated at the mesophyll level. There were few
   interactions between nitrogen and rootstocks, and their contribution to
   total variance was small relative to main effects. Thus, with the
   exception of SO4, differences due to rootstocks were mostly unaffected
   by soil nitrogen level.},

Abstract = {This paper describes variation in transpiration efficiency `W' (where
   W=dry matter produced/water transpired) among grapevine genotypes grown
   under well-watered conditions in either a glasshouse or a vineyard.
   Nineteen genotypes were grown in a glasshouse where growth and
   transpiration were measured. W ranged from 2.5 to 3.4 g dm/kg H2O
   transpired. Carbon-isotope discrimination (Delta) of laminae dry matter
   ranged from 20.8 to 22.7 parts per thousand and there was a negative
   relationship (R-2=0.58) between W and Delta. A large proportion of
   variation in W could be attributed to variation in stomatal conductance.
   Genotypic variation in photosynthetic capacity was also an important
   component of variation in W. In a second experiment, lamina Delta was
   measured for mature field-grown Shiraz and Chardonnay, grown either on
   their own roots or grafted to five different rootstocks, and maintained
   at three sites under well-watered conditions. At all sites and
   regardless of rootstock, the laminae of Chardonnay had Delta values 1 to
   2\%. lower than Shiraz. There was also a 1 to 2 parts per thousand
   variation among the sites. Rootstock variety affected Delta values
   inconsistently and by a maximum of 0.5 parts per thousand. Leaf gas
   exchange measurements were performed at a single site on sun-exposed
   leaves of Chardonnay and Shiraz on either their own roots or 1103
   Paulsen, a moderate to high vigour rootstock. There was no significant
   effect of rootstock on leaf gas exchange and photosynthetic rates did
   not differ between scion varieties. However, Chardonnay had a 20\% lower
   stomatal conductance and a 1.4-fold higher ratio of CO2 assimilation/H2O
   transpiration (A/T) indicating a potentially higher W, at a leaf level,
   for Chardonnay compared with Shiraz. We conclude that photosynthetic
   capacity was also higher for Chardonnay. Delta values, predicted from
   the C-i/C-a ratio calculated from leaf gas exchange measurements, did
   not differ significantly from measured values for laminae Delta. This
   similarity for Delta, in conjunction with the fact that the lower Delta
   of Chardonnay was reflected in a higher A/T ratio, suggests that Delta
   may be a reliable predictor of comparative W under vineyard conditions.},

Title = {Iron deficiency and chlorosis in orchard and vineyard ecosystems},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {71-92},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Several perennial, deciduous, as well as evergreen fruit crops develop
   symptoms of iron deficiency - interveinal chlorosis of apical
   leaves-when cultivated in calcareous and alkaline soils. Under these
   conditions fruit yield and quality is depressed in the current year and
   fruit buds poorly develop for following year fruiting. This paper
   reviews the main fundamental and applied aspects of iron (Fe) nutrition
   of deciduous fruit crops and grapevine and discusses the possible
   development of sustainable Fe nutrition management in orchard and
   vineyard ecosystems. Cultivated grapevines and most deciduous fruit
   trees are made up of two separate genotypes the cultivar and the
   rootstock, providing the root system to the tree. The effect of the
   rootstock on scion tolerance of Fe chlorosis is discussed in terms of
   biochemical responses of the roots to acquire iron from the soil.
   Symptoms of iron chlorosis in orchards and vineyards are usually more
   frequent in spring when shoot growth is rapid and bicarbonate
   concentration in the soil solution buffers soil pH in the rhizosphere
   and root apoplast. Since the solubility of Fe-oxides is pH dependent,
   under alkaline and calcareous soils inorganic Fe availability is far
   below that required to satisfy plant demand, so major role on Fe
   nutrition of trees is likely played by the iron chelated by microbial
   siderophores, chelated by phytosiderophores (released into the soil by
   graminaceous species) and complexed by organic, matter. As most fruit
   tree species belong to Strategy I-based plants (which do not produce
   phytosiderophores in their roots) Fe uptake is preceded by a reduction
   step from Fe3+ to Fe2+. The role of ferric chelate reductase and proton
   pump activities in Fe uptake and the possible adoption of these
   measurements for screening procedure in selecting Fe chlorosis tolerant
   rootstocks are discussed. In a chlorotic leaf the existence of Fe pools
   which are somehow inactivated has been demonstrated, suggesting that
   part of the Fe coming from the roots does not pass the leaf
   plasmamembrane and may be confined to the apoplast: the reasons and the
   importance for inactivation of Fe in the apoplast are discussed. The use
   of Fe chlorosis tolerant genotypes as rootstocks in orchards and
   vineyards represents a reliable solution to prevent iron chlorosis; in
   some species, however, available Fe chlorosis resistant rootstocks are
   not very attractive from an agronomic point of view since they often
   induce excessive growth of the scion and reduce fruit yields. As most
   fruit tree crops and grapes are high value commodities, in many
   countries growers are often willing to apply synthetic Fe chelates to
   cure or to prevent the occurrence of Fe deficiency. The application of
   iron chelates does not represent a sustainable way to prevent or cure
   iron chlorosis because of to their costs and of the environmental risks
   associated with their use. Since Fe chelates were introduced, little
   research on alternative means for controlling the chlorosis has been
   performed. Sustainable management of Fe nutrition in orchards and
   vineyards should include all genetical and agronomical means in order to
   naturally enhance Fe availability in the soil and in the plant. Special
   attention should be given to soil analysis and to prevention measures
   carried out before planting. Alternatives to iron chelates are being
   developed and in the future they should be included into the routine
   practices or managing fruit trees and grapevine under Integrated
   Production and Organic Farming. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {A cooperative study was initiated between the University of Arkansas and
   California State University, Fresno, to determine the effect of
   rootstock on productivity, fruit, and wine composition. Viticultural
   data were collected for four years in Arkansas and three years in
   California, and wine was made one year. Chardonel scion wood was
   bench-grafted on Cynthiana, Freedom, Kober 5BB, and Richter 110
   rootstock. Grafted vines and own-rooted vines were planted in
   Fayetteville, AR, and Fresno, CA. Vineyard establishment, trellis
   systems, and cultural practices were standardized between locations. The
   two locations have different soils and climates, and results differed
   between locations. Grapes grown in Fresno (3 year means) had higher
   total soluble solids (23.5 Brix) and titratable acidity (8.0 g/L) and
   lower pH (3.44) than grapes grown in Fayetteville (4 year means), which
   had 20.5 Brix, 6.4 g/L titratable acidity, and 3.60 pH. The greatest
   benefits of using rootstocks were seen in Fayetteville, where yield
   increases of 40 and 19\% were obtained with 5BB and 110R, respectively,
   as compared to own-rooted vines. Cynthiana produced the lowest yields,
   and Freedom produced the largest vine size at both locations. Grapes
   from vines grafted to 110R had a lower pH than own-rooted vines at
   Fayetteville. Otherwise, there were few composition differences between
   own-rooted, Freedom, 5BB, and 110R rootstocks. Wines produced from fruit
   of vines grafted to Freedom had the highest pH at both locations. There
   were few other differences in wine pH or acidity among grapes that were
   not attributable to fruit maturity. There was not a major advantage to
   using rootstock in Fresno. The use of 110R seems to hold an advantage in
   Fayetteville over own-rooted vines due to higher yield and lower pH.},

Title = {Yield-salinity relationships of different grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.)
   scion-rootstock combinations},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {150-156},
Abstract = {Three data sets derived from 5- or 6-year field experiments at Merbein
   (Victoria), Dareton (New South Wales) and Loxton (South Australia) were
   used to assess the relationship between yield of own-rooted or grafted
   grapevines and electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste
   extract (ECe). This involved a non-linear least squares fit method to
   determine the threshold of ECe it which yield begins to decline and the
   slope of the yield reduction with increasing ECe above that threshold.
   Threshold and slope are the two key parameters in this piecewise linear
   model of grapevine response to salinity. The soil ECe values were
   integrated to take account of both spatial and temporal variation in
   soil salinity within the profile. The ECe threshold for own-rooted
   Sultana at Merbein in the Sunraysia region was found to be 2.3 +/- 0.2
   dS/m and the slope of yield reduction above the threshold was 8.9 +/-
   1.2 \% per 1 dS/m increase in soil ECe. At Dareton, a similar threshold
   of 2.1 +/- 0.3 dS/m was found for own-rooted Sultana, however the higher
   slope of the yield reduction (15.0 +/- 2.0 \%) relative to the same
   vines at Merbein may have been related to the higher sodium adsorption
   ratio (SAR) in irrigation water and its impacts on soil physical
   properties, especially in that part of the vineyard with a heavier soil
   type. The rootstock Ramsey resulted in a threshold of 3.3 +/- 0.2 dS/m
   and slope of 5.7 +/- 0.4 \% with the scion Colombard at Loxton,
   indicating a more tolerant combination of scion-rootstock to salinity.
   The rootstocks 1103 Paulsen and R2 with Sultana as scion were the most
   salt tolerant, with no discernible yield reduction until ECe exceeded
   about 4 dS/m. Of four other rootstocks with Sultana as scion, compared
   with own-rooted sultana, J17-69, and R4 had similar threshold values
   (2.3 +/- 0.2 and 2.5 +/- 0.2 dS/m) and slopes of yield reduction (10.1
   +/- 1.9 \% and 8.0 +/- 0.5 \%, respectively), while R1 had a similar
   threshold of 1.8 +/- 0.2 dS/m but a lower slope of yield reduction (4.3
   +/- 0.9 \%) than Sultana on own roots and R3, J17-69, R1 and R4
   rootstocks. Comparatively, R3 rootstock responded differently by way of
   a higher threshold of 3.0 +/- 0.2 dS/m than own-rooted Sultana and
   J17-69 and R1 rootstocks and a higher slope of yield reduction of 12.4
   +/- 1.0 \% relative to Sultana on own roots and R4 and R1 rootstocks.
   Based on our long-term studies of yield-salinity relationships on
   contrasting sites, the pre-eminence of certain rootstocks in conferring
   tolerance to soil salinity has been confirmed. Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen, and
   a new hybrid designed here as R3 were generally outstanding, with Ramsey
   varying only slightly in its comparative effectiveness when grafted to
   different scion varieties. An overall interaction between scion variety
   and rootstock genotype was thus evident in the form of yield-salinity
   relationships.},

   Whole-plant biomass in all graftlings more than doubled with increased N

   Biomass allocation to roots declined with increased N supply for all

   rootstock genotype. Nitrate reductase activity (NRA) in leaves increased
   with increased N supply for all stock-scion combinations, whereas root
   NRA increased only up to I mM N supply, dropping markedly with
   additional N. NRA in leaves was one to two orders of magnitude higher
   than NRA in roots - a difference that increased steadily with increased
   N supply. By implication, grapevine leaves have a much higher capacity

Abstract = {Mycorrhizal colonization of grafted grapevines was studied during early
   establishment of an experimental rootstock vineyard to determine
   rootstock variability forming functional mycorrhizas. Roots of 10
   different rootstocks were examined for the presence of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi at the end of the second growing season (1998),
   and at the time of veraison (onset of ripening) of the third (1999) and
   fourth (2000) growing seasons. The fine root length density (primary
   roots with intact cortex) increased in 6 of 10 rootstocks over time.
   Only one rootstock, Riparia Gloire, showed a marked decrease in fine
   root length density in 2000, when vines carried their first significant
   fruit crop. AM colonization was generally above 60\% of fine root length
   for all rootstocks, although significant differences due to rootstock
   and time of sampling were evident. Rootstocks imparting greater vigor to
   the scion, particularly Ruggeri 140, Kober 513B, and SO-4 had
   consistently higher levels of root colonization by AM fungi. The
   proportion of roots containing arbuscules at veraison declined from 1999
   to 2000 in those rootstocks carrying the highest crop loads. While AM
   colonization of different rootstocks was positively correlated to yield,
   the proportion of roots with arbuscules was negatively correlated to
   yield in 2000. Results of this study show that small differences in the
   ability to form mycorrhizas exist among rootstocks, but other factors,
   including crop load and soil moisture, have a large influence on root
   colonization by AM fungi.},

Abstract = {Little information is presently available on the disease aetiology and
   epidemiology of the fungi involved in the decline of young vines. To
   address this question, four rootstock-scion combinations, originating
   from three commercial nurseries in the Wellington area of the Western
   Cape Province of South Africa were investigated during the 1999/2000
   season. The first isolations were made in September from callused
   cuttings prior to planting in nurseries. After planting, asymptomatic
   rooted cuttings were selected from nurseries after 3, 6 and 9 months.
   Isolations were made from the roots, rootstock, grafting union and
   scion. Isolations from callused cuttings prior to planting clearly
   demonstrated that primary pathogens associated with Petri disease, such
   as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp. were already
   present in the apparently healthy rootstock propagation material as
   endophytes. However, Cylindrocarpon spp., which cause black foot
   disease, rarely occurred in propagation material at this time. Species
   of this genus were isolated at higher percentages later during the
   season. Less than 1\% of the plants were infected with Cylindrocarpon
   spp. before planting in the nursery (October), whereas 50\% or more of
   the plants were infected at the end of the season (June). These findings
   suggest that the low percentage survival of vine plants observed in
   recent years is partly due to infected propagation material, and to new
   infections established in nurseries.},

Abstract = {Potassium (K) is essential for vine growth and yield. Grape berries are
   a strong sink for K, particularly during ripening. Excess K levels in
   grape berries may have a negative impact on wine quality, mainly because
   it decreases free tartaric acid resulting in an increase in the pH of
   grape juice, must and wine. In Australia, high K status is common in
   most vineyards, which reflects the high K and high pH values of most
   Australian grape juice. This necessitates pH adjustment during the
   vinification process, and tartaric acid addition is a common practice in
   most Australian wineries. High K concentration may also lead to
   excessive loss of the additional tartaric acid by precipitation as
   potassium bitartrate and, as a consequence, pH adjustment becomes more
   difficult and expensive. Ensuring naturally low K levels in the berry
   will help reduce costs of input and waste management at the winery.
   Potential vineyard management options to manipulate berry K accumulation
   include selective use of rootstock/scion combination, canopy management
   and irrigation strategies. However, the impact of these practices on
   determining the optimum K concentration requires careful calibration of
   production parameters and the desirable grape juice and wine quality in
   relation to tissue K concentration. This paper reviews and discusses the
   possible functions of K in grape berries, translocation of K into the
   berry, and genetic and cultural factors that may affect the accumulation
   of K in the berry. This will help to identify the key research and
   management strategies needed for controlling K concentrations in grape
   berries.},

Abstract = {In Hungary the detection of virus and virus-like diseases of grapevine
   began in 1960's at the Research Institute for Viticulture and Enology by
   Janos Lehoczky and his colleagues. At present sixteen virus and
   virus-like diseases of Vitis vinifera are known to occur in Hungary.
   Some of these viruses, for example fanleaf and leafroll cause
   significant yield loss and/or lower fruit quality. Other virus diseases,
   for example, Rugose wood complex can provoke untimely death of grapevine
   stocks. A few viruses are latent. Little is known about their effects on
   grapevine, however occurrence of these diseases is quite frequent, so
   they may have high economic importance.
   Regular virological screening of grapevine varieties started in 1972.
   The present system of screening (visual selection, indexing, ELISA) has
   been established using methods with continuous improvement according to
   recommendations of international organizations. In the first year
   symptomless grapevine plants are selected and marked during surveys
   carried out twice in the vegetation period: at about flowering and in
   the second half of September. At the first selection time plants are
   sampled for ELISA. In the spring of the second year, overwintered canes
   are checked by woody indexing on 8 indicator species in the field. In
   the third and fourth years the nursery is evaluated twice again. At the
   end, the marked grapevine plants, giving negative results on all
   indicators in every case, are considered virus-free. In autumn of the
   fourth year, the virus-free material is planted out under screenhouse
   and also in a special mother block (nuclear stock) for maintenance and
   propagation. During these propagation steps, visual observation and
   random tests by ELISA are done to monitor the virus status of the
   plants. The propagation is performed under strict official control by
   the National Plant Protection Service. Trueness to type is also
   monitored by the inspectors of National Institute for Agricultural
   Quality Control.
   Mother blocks of virus-free scion varieties have been established on 2
   ha and those of rootstock varieties on 0,5 ha planted with the following
   number of varieties included in the national list: 71 European scion -
   and 12 rootstock varieties or variety candidates/clones. Number of other
   virus-free varieties and clones: 42. There are 167,8 ha of virus-free
   Pre-base, Base and Certified stocks from 71 European scion varieties and
   98,4 ha from 12 rootstock varieties. So it is necessary to increase the
   area of Pre-base, Base and Certified stocks exclusively with tested
   virus-free (clean) material. It can be said that the sanitary and clone
   selection, maintenance and propagation of the vine meets EU standards in
   Hungary.},

Abstract = {In the years from 1980 to 1990, approximately 90\% of all grafted vines
   were produced solely for export. In 1984, a total of 41,5 million
   grafted vines were exported. Due to the embargo this figure dropped
   significantly during the period from 1991 to 1998, down to approximately
   1-1.5 million grafted vines per year. After the embargo was lifted,
   export picked up considerably to approximately 3 million grafted vines
   in the year 2000. In 2001, a total export of 4 to 5 million vines is
   expected. In order to get an insight into the influence of certain
   rootstocks and their clones on agrobiological and technological
   characteristics of scion varieties numerous investigations were
   conducted focusing primarily on: percentage of 1(st) Class grafts in the
   nursery, fruit quantity and quality, resistance to biotic and abiotic
   factors, and the influence of genetic origin on yield and other
   agrobiological characteristics.},

Abstract = {Potential problems associated with saline irrigation waters can be
   compounded by irrigation practices. Methods for water application become
   of prime importance under saline conditions. The effect of irrigation
   water quantity and salinity on fruit yield, fruit quality and leaf
   mineral composition were studied in a field experiment with 6-year-old
   lemon trees, cv. Fino 49, on the Macrophylla, (Citrus Macrophylla
   Wester) rootstock during 1998-2000. Trees were irri.-ated with three
   different qualities of water, having an electrical conductivity 1, 2.5
   and 4 dS/m, respectively. For each salinity treatment, trees were
   irrigated with two different quantities of water, 100 and 125\% crop
   evapotranspiration. Lemon fruit yield significantly decreased with
   increasing salinity, due to a decrease in the number of fruits per tree.
   This reduction was caused by an increase in fruitlet drop off induced by
   salinity. A significant increase of lemon fruit yield was observed in
   the last year by increasing the quantity of water. Salinity and amount
   of water applied affected fruit quality. The percentage of fruit juice,
   with respect to the total fruit weight, was greater in fruits from the
   control than for those in the salinity treatments. The opposite effect
   was observed for peel and pulp contents. Titratable acidity (TA) and
   total soluble solids (TSS) decreased with salinity, although the ratio
   TSS:TA was similar in all treatments. Chloride and sodium concentrations
   in leaves were raised by salinity and amounts of water applied. Data on
   accumulation of other nutrients in relation to salinity, water
   application and season are also presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {The dogwood borer, Synanthedon scitula (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae),
   has the broadest host range of the clearwing moths and is considered to
   be an economically important pest of many ornamental, fruit, and nut
   trees. Since the 1980s, dogwood borer has been recognized as an
   increasingly important, indirect pest of apple, Malus domestica Borkh.
   (Rosaceae), in eastern North America, owing mainly to increased
   plantings of apple on size-controlling rootstocks that promote the
   formation of adventitious root initials (burr knots) on the rootstock
   and scion. Burr knots appear to be preferred oviposition sites for
   dogwood borer females, although infestations can also be initiated in
   wounds, pruning cuts, and crotches on the branches and trunk. Larval
   feeding in burr knots does not adversely affect the growth and vigor of
   apple trees, but their mining outward from burr knots into vascular
   tissue can ultimately cause tree decline and death. Chlorpyrifos is the
   most effective insecticide for controlling dogwood borer. A supplemental
   label in the United States permits post-bloom, trunk drench applications
   of chlorpyrifos specifically for control of borers in apple, with
   several restrictions that preclude control of infestations higher in the
   tree. The ongoing review of pesticide tolerances dictated by the 1996
   Food Quality Protection Act of the United States of America makes the
   long-term availability of this chemical uncertain. Cultural practices,
   such as deeper planting or berming, can reduce the likelihood of
   infestation of new apple plantings by dogwood borer, although they do
   not preclude infestations from developing above the graft union. This
   review and discussion is based on our contention that research toward
   the development of alternative, behaviorally based management strategies
   for dogwood borer in apple and other economically important host plants
   is warranted. Our review and synthesis of the dogwood borer literature
   revealed important gaps in knowledge about basic aspects of its biology
   that pertain directly to the development of alternative control tactics
   based on behavioral manipulation. There is considerable confusion
   surrounding the sex pheromone of dogwood borer and conflicting results
   on the response of males to isomers and blends of isomers of its
   purported pheromone. Studies using sex attractants to monitor its
   phenology in apple and non-apple habitats have yielded discrepant
   results and conclusions. Differences in the effectiveness of
   commercially available pheromone lures for trapping dogwood borer have
   been reported and the ability of pheromone traps to accurately reflect
   emergence or population density remains in question. Regardless of
   pronounced differences in the duration and modality of the seasonal
   flight of dogwood borer among different geographical regions within its
   range, the conclusion of univoltinism across most of its range has been
   perpetuated, based on extremely limited developmental data collected
   exclusively from individuals that developed on dogwood.},

Abstract = {American chestnut, hybrid hazelnut and grapevine were cultured in vitro

   micrografted on in vitro-propagated unrooted rootstocks by hand. The
   scions (2-4 cm) and rootstocks (23 cm) were fixed using an elastic
   electric-wire tube or alginate gel beads. After grafting, the bases of
   rootstocks were dipped in 1000 ppm indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) solution
   for 5 s (grapevine) or 10 s (American chestnut and hybrid hazelnut).
   Grafted plantlets were then cultured in jiffy peat plugs in vitro or
   placed in jiffy peat plugs ex vitro and were gradually acclimatized.
   Scions of in vitro cultured grafts developed aerial roots and the
   grafting was unsuccessful. Two months after grafting, the survival of
   successful ex vitro grafts was ca. 50\% for grapevine, 70\% for
   hazelnut, and 80\% for American chestnut. The results indicate that,

   scion and rootstocks can simultaneously be grafted, rooted and

   were planted into various soil textures in a completely randomized block
   design with five replications for each rootstock. Each site was planted
   to a single scion variety and farmed commercially. Own-rooted control
   vines at all sites were sampled during spring 1992, 1993, and 1994 to
   determine nematode infestation. All rootstocks were then sampled from
   eight infected sites until 1998. Nematode counts differed among
   rootstocks, but Xiphinema index populations performed similarly at seven
   sites as they increased, peaked, and then declined within several years.
   Based on nematode densities, Harmony, Freedom, and VR O39-16 were rated
   resistant to X. index. In two vineyards Xiphinema americanum multiplied
   equally well on all rootstocks and exhibited minimal population decline
   thereafter. No single rootstock performed optimally with any
   consistency. Annual fruit yields (marketable + cull fruit) over a
   six-year interval (1993 to 1998) were accumulated to obtain average
   yield. Among the best rootstocks was 1103P, but it also supported
   highest population levels of X. index. Harmony and 101-14 Mgt were
   generally the lowest yielding, but other rootstocks performed poorly
   within specific scion and field settings. This study provides
   information on two dagger nematode species, their population dynamics
   after soil fumigation, and their interactions with selected grape
   rootstocks. It also raises questions about field trial designs for
   rootstock studies.},

   rootstocks, `Gisela 5' and `Edabriz'. This fact allows the inference
   that invigorating rootstocks could keep scion growth active for longer
   periods, lengthening the photosynthetically active season and individual
   shoot growth. This could be a consequence of a delayed arrival of the
   flux of hormonal compounds to the canopy, that determine the entrance
   into dormancy and leaf senescence and fall.},

Abstract = {Developments of quality grapevine production in Slovenia have recently
   required a lot of changes in winegrowing practice, especially in
   training systems and planting density. For that purpose several
   preliminary experiments have been done with different rootstock/scion
   combinations in vineyards and in the nursery. We were looking for
   rootstocks with weak or moderate vigour, good phylloxera resistance
   (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae FITCH) and good performance in drought
   conditions. In four field nursery experiments the rootstock `420 A MGt'
   showed the weakest root and shoot growth, while the rootstock `Paulsen
   1103' mostly performed distinctive growth of roots and it advanced
   further shoot growth. According to root weight the rootstocks `Kober
   5BB' and `Teleki SO 4' in some cases came close to `Paulsen 1103', but
   they did not always enable the transfer of roots vigorous growth to
   shoots. Two experiments in vineyard confirmed strong vegetative growth
   hypothesis of `Paulsen 1103'. In one case rootstock `Fercal' came close
   to `Paulsen 1103' and in other case `Kober 5BB' and `Ruggeri 140' were
   close, too. At the nursery experiment in 2001, we found significant high
   number of phylloxera nodosities on one-year grafts of cv. `Rebula'
   grafted on rootstock `3309 C'.},

Abstract = {The percentage of GFLV-affected plants and its geographical

   Ximenez{''} grapevine cultivars from respectively ``Aljarafe{''} of
   Sevilla, ``Condado de Huelva{''} of Huelva and ``Montilla-Moriles{''} of
   Cordoba were determined. All the plots in ``Aljarafe{''} zone presented
   some plants with virus (average 14.2\%), and higher incidence in the
   North (> 20\%) than in the South (< 6\%). The ``Zalema{''}
   GFLV-distribution was more heterogeneous, being the central area, with
   better wine quality, that with lower virus-attack (8.7\%). The infection
   average of this cultivar was 27.5\%. In the ``Montilla-Moriles{''} zone,
   the infection average was 26.2\% and the geographical distribution was
   very heterogeneous. Nevertheless the vineyards with higher virus attack
   appear grouped. This area was the only with some plots free of GFLV
   presence. No relation was established between GFLV-infection and plant
   density or rootstock type and low relationship was found with plant age,
   bad cultural conditions and Xiphinema index or italiae. The use of non
   controlled GFLV-infected scion for grafting was the most important way
   of virus transmission. The in vitro culture was a good method for the
   obtaining of GFLV free plants, reaching even 100\%. The in vitro culture
   was also interesting to establish differences between the non-infected
   and infected plant material, according to the in vitro plant stem
   growth, being significantly lower in the infected one. In a field
   experiment with ``Zalema{''} cultivar, signs of juvenility (very high
   growth, red colour and pubescens in leaves and no production) were
   observed in the growing scions the first year after grafting. In the
   following years those sings disappeared and the production was
   practically two-fold of the normal field surrounding plants.},

Abstract = {One of the major environmental safety issues over transgenic crops
   containing virus-derived genes relates to the outcome of recombination
   events between viral transgene transcripts and RNAs from indigenous
   virus populations. We addressed this issue by assessing the emergence of
   viable Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) recombinants in transgenic
   grapevines expressing the GFLV coat protein (CP) gene. Test plants
   consisted of nontransgenic scions grafted onto transgenic and
   nontransgenic rootstocks that were exposed over 3 years to
   nematode-mediated GFLV infection in two distinct vineyard sites. The CP
   gene of challenging GFLV isolates was amplified from scions by
   IC-RT-PCR, and characterized by RFLP and nucleotide sequencing using
   strain F13 as reference since it provided the CP transgene. Analysis of
   EcoRI and StyI RFLP banding patterns from 347 challenging GFLV isolates
   and sequence data from 85 variants revealed no characteristics similar
   to strain F13 and no difference in the molecular variability among
   isolates from 190 transgenic and 157 nontransgenic plants, or from
   plants within (253 individuals) or outside (94 individuals) of the two
   sites. Interestingly, five GFLV recombinants were identified in three
   nontransgenic plants located outside of the two field settings. This
   survey indicates that transgenic grapevines did not assist the emergence
   of viable GFLV recombinants to detectable levels nor did they affect the
   molecular diversity of indigenous GFLV populations during the trial
   period. This is the first report on safety assessment of recombination
   with a transgenic crop expressing a CP gene under field conditions of
   heavy disease pressure but low, if any, selection pressure against

Title = {Implications of nitrogen nutrition for grapes, fermentation and wine},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {242-295},
Abstract = {This review discusses the impacts of nitrogen addition in the vineyard
   and winery, and establishes the effects that nitrogen has on grape berry
   and wine composition and the sensory attributes of wine. Nitrogen is the
   most abundant soil-derived macronutrient in a grapevine, and plays a
   major role in many of the biological functions and processes of both
   grapevine and fermentative microorganisms. Manipulation of grapevine
   nitrogen nutrition has the potential to influence quality components in
   the grape and, ultimately, the wine. In addition, fermentation kinetics
   and formation of flavour-active metabolites are also affected by the
   nitrogen status of the must, which can be further manipulated by
   addition of nitrogen in the winery. The only consistent effect of
   nitrogen application in the vineyard on grape berry quality components
   is an increase in the concentration of the major nitrogenous compounds,
   such as total nitrogen, total amino acids, arginine, proline and
   ammonium, and consequently (y) under bar east-(a) under bar ssimilable
   (n) under bar itrogen (YAN). Both the form and amount of YAN have
   significant implications for wine quality. Low must YAN leads to low
   yeast populations and poor fermentation vigour, increased risk of
   sluggish/stuck/slow fermentations, increased production of undesirable
   thiols (e.g. hydrogen sulfide) and higher alcohols, and low production
   of esters and long chain volatile fatty acids. High must YAN leads to
   increased biomass and higher maximum heat output due to greater
   fermentation vigour, and increased formation of ethyl acetate, acetic
   acid and volatile acidity. Increased concentrations of haze-causing
   proteins, urea and ethyl carbamate and biogenic amines are also
   associated with high YAN musts. The risk of microbial instability,
   potential taint from Botrytis-infected fruit and possibly atypical
   ageing character is also increased. Intermediate must YAN favours the
   best balance between desirable and undesirable chemical and sensory wine
   attributes. `Macro tuning', of berry nitrogen status can be achieved in
   the vineyard, given genetic constraints, but the final `micro tuning'
   can be more readily achieved in the winery by the use of nitrogen
   supplements, such as diammonium phosphate (DAP) and the choice of
   fermentation conditions. This point highlights the need to monitor
   nitrogen not only in the vineyard but also in the must immediately
   before fermentation, so that appropriate additions can be made when
   required. Overall, optimisation of vineyard and fermentation nitrogen
   can contribute to quality factors in wine and hence affect its value.
   However, a better understanding of the effect of nitrogen on grape
   secondary metabolites and different types of nitrogen sources on yeast
   flavour metabolism and wine sensory properties is still required.},

Abstract = {Level of affinity between grapevine rootstock and Vitis vinifera as
   scion, quality of reproductive materials and technological actions in
   grapevine rootstock production process determine success in grapevine
   rootstock production in large extent. Practical training showed that
   difference in level of compatibility between grapevine rootstock and
   grafted Vitis vinifera cultivars are existing. Direct effects of these
   differences are unequal yield of first class grafted grapevine
   rootlings. In this paper, level of compatibility in nursery between
   clones of cv. Chardonnay BCL 75, VCR4 and cv. Merlot R18, MCL 519 and
   grapevine rootstocks Kober 5BB (Vitis berlandieri x V. riparia), SO4 (V.
   berlandieri x V. riparia) and 41B (Chasselas x V. berlandieri) were
   investigated. The trial was conducted in commercial grapevine nursery
   located in Velika Drenova, Serbia. As an index of compatibility, grade
   of high quality grapevine grafted rootlings, dry matter in mature shoots
   and root system development were used. Grafting was done by `tongue
   grafting' indoor technique. Stratification was done in sand, on
   temperature of the stratification material of 26-28 degrees C, and
   humidity of around 90\%. Grafted cuttings were waxed twice: before
   stratifi cation, and before planting in the nursery. Grafted rootlings
   were classed in two classes according to regulations of quality,
   (Yugoslav Official Register, 26/79). Grafted rootlings that did not
   satisfied standard criteria were discarded. Both clones of cv.
   Chardonnay gave the highest percentage of I class grafted rootlings on
   grapevine rootstock 41B: clone BCL 75 -60\% and clone VCR4 - 61\%. In
   the same combination, those grapevine grafted rootlings had the highest
   weight of the root system. Lower percentage of obtained I class grafted
   rootlings was established on rootstock Kober 5BB, while statistically
   significantly lower yields were obtained on grapevine rootstock SO4:
   clone BCL75 - 43\% and clone VCR4 - 48\%. Dry matter content in mature
   shoots is showing good maturity of shoots in cv. Chardonnay in all

   In the same experiment combination the highest root weight was

   obtained by grafting Merlot clones on rootstock SO4, that is shown by
   significantly lower percentage of produced I class grafted rootlings in
   relation to obtained values by grafting on other examined grapevine
   rootstocks (clone R18/SO4 - 51\%; clone MCL519/SO4 - 50\%).},

Abstract = {Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are plant cell-wall
   proteins that specifically inhibit fungal endo-polygalacturonases (PGs)
   that contribute to the aggressive decomposition of susceptible plant
   tissues. The inhibition of fungal PGs by PGIPs suggests that PGIPs have
   a role in plant tolerance to fungal infections and this has been
   observed in transgenic plants expressing PGIPs. Xylella fastidiosa, the
   causal agent of Pierce's disease (PD) in grapevines, has genes that
   encode cell-wall-clegrading enzymes, including a putative PG. Therefore,
   we hypothesized that PGIP expression could confer tolerance against this
   bacterium as well as against the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. To
   test this hypothesis, Vitis vinifera cvs.'Thompson Seedless' and
   `Chardonnay' were transformed to express pear fruit PGIP-encoding gene
   (pPGIP) under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Substantial pear
   PGIP (pPGlP) activity was found in, crude extracts from leaves and in
   xylem exudate of transgenic lines obtained from independent
   transformation events, but not in untransformed controls. pPGlP activity
   was detected in xylem exudate of untransformed scions grafted on to
   transgenic' rootstocks expressing pPGIP. Leaves of transgenic plants
   infected with B. cinerea had reduced rates of lesion expansion. The
   development of PD was delayed in some transgenic lines with increased
   pPGlP activity. PD-tolerant transgenic lines had reduced leaf scorching,
   lower Xylella titres and better re-growth after pruning than the
   untransformed controls.},

Abstract = {Micrografting of grapevine was investigated for its use as a tool in
   virus indexing of grapevine stock. Cabernet franc and Cabernet sauvignon
   scions infected with grapevine leafroll-associated closterovirus III
   (GLRaVIII) were grafted on to virus-free indicator rootstocks of LN 33
   and Cabernet sauvignon growing in tissue culture. The two rootstocks and
   two scions were grafted in all four possible combinations along with two
   control grafts (virus-free scion on virus-free rootstock). A modified MS
   Murashige and Skoog (1962) tissue culture medium supplemented with 0.5
   mg 1(-1) 6-benzylaminopurine was sufficient to induce multiple shoots.
   Shoots and micrografts readily produced roots in the basal medium.
   Micrografting gave an overall success rate of 77.8\%, with no
   significant difference between LN 33 rootstock and Cabernet sauvignon.
   When leafroll infected scion material was micrografted on to virus-free
   rootstock, the rootstock leaf turned red (23.5\% in LN 33 and 63.9\% in
   Cabernet sauvignon) or it showed leafrolling (28.5\%, no significant
   difference between LN 33 and Cabernet sauvignon) within 2-3 weeks. After
   12 weeks in culture, the extent of viral symptoms in the micrografted
   material was high (81.3\%), with no significant difference between LN 33
   and Cabernet sauvignon; however, the expression of symptoms was more
   severe on Cabernet sauvignon than on LN 33 rootstock. Double antibody
   sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) was used to
   validate the visual symptoms and the presence of virus was confirmed in
   80\% of the rootstock with visual symptoms of infection. Results
   indicate that micrografting is an effective method for viral indexing of
   grapevines. The method can be used in conjunction with wood indexing for
   post-entry quarantine to identify infected material and reject it much
   earlier than is currently possible.},

Title = {Grapevine rooting patterns: A comprehensive analysis and a review},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-104},
Abstract = {Grapevines are grown either on their own roots or on rootstocks that
   represent a mixture of grapevine species and hybrids. Developmental and
   physiological factors other than phylloxera resistance, lime tolerance,
   and ease of propagation were not directly considered during rootstock
   breeding, including rooting patterns. Here, in a comprehensive
   literature synthesis, we have compiled information concerning rooting
   depth distributions of grapevine roots from wall profile studies
   comprising a broad range of soil environments and rootstock genotypes.
   We considered the distributions based on the asymptotic equation of Y =
   (1 - beta(d)), where d = soil depth (cm) and Y = the proportion of roots
   from the surface to depth d. The median value of beta for the root
   distributions analyzed was 0.9826 and the standard deviation over all
   observations was 0.0068 (n = 240); most profiles had fitted values of
   beta generally greater than 0.975. This value places the depth
   distribution of grapevine roots in the vadose zone among the deepest
   observed for plants worldwide. The data suggested that soil properties
   such as the presence of soil profiles impermeable to root penetration,
   stoniness, and presence of gravel lenses have a greater influence on
   depth distributions than does genotype, even in deep fertile soils.
   Genotypic differences were not apparent, although the rootstock O39-16
   (beta = 0.9867 +/- 0.0009, mean +/- se, n = 11), with a reputation for
   deep-rooting behavior, did exhibit deeper root distributions. The
   analysis also suggests that root characteristics other than root
   horizontal and vertical spread may need to be considered in order to
   explain some key rootstock characteristics like scion vigor or drought
   tolerance.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Limited water resources are placing pressure on the wine grape industry
   to improve vineyard water use efficiency by continuing improvements in
   vineyard management. One way to improve vineyard water use efficiency is
   to improve transpiration efficiency, and judicious use of
   scion-rootstock combination can play a role. Accordingly, this paper
   examines the influence of rootstocks on the water use physiology of a
   common scion variety (Shiraz) and assesses the importance of variation
   in xylem sap abscisic acid (ABA) as an indicator of relative water use
   efficiency of different scion-rootstock combinations. Shiraz scions
   (clone BVRC12) grafted to seven rootstock varieties (along with an
   ungrafted control), were observed over two consecutive seasons in a
   field trial located in Adelaide, South Australia. Those two seasons
   (2001/02 and 2002/03) offered sharp contrasts with respect to soil and
   atmospheric water stress. Rootstock genotype had a significant impact on
   scion gas exchange, water status, canopy growth and yield in both
   seasons. Those impacts were associated with an inverse relationship
   between xylem sap ABA and stomatal conductance. We suggest that
   strategic analysis of xylem sap ABA may provide a marker for comparative
   water-use physiology of different stock-scion combinations, while
   recognising that irrigation pre-history, and associated degree of vine
   water stress, will be a further source of variation in grapevine water
   use.},

Abstract = {Sunmuscat scions, either grafted onto one of seven rootstock, or as
   own-rooted vines, were grown under irrigation according to the practices
   of warm-climate viticulture in north-western Victoria. The trial was
   located within a commercial vineyard on a sandy loam soil, and
   represented a typical replant situation. Grapevine performance was
   assessed over five seasons, viz. 1999-2004 inclusive, in terms of yield
   per vine, berry weight, juice composition and vigour (based on trunk
   girth). The highest yielding rootstock over the trial period was 1103
   Paulsen (28.9 kg/vine) followed by 140 Ruggeri and Ramsey (26.1 and 25.8
   kg/vine respectively), S04 (22.5 kg/vine), Schwarzmann, 101-14 and
   Teleki 5A (19.9, 18.7 and 18.4 kg/vine respectively). Scions on their
   own roots returned lowest yield (15.5 kg/vine). Berry weights were
   largest for the three high yielding rootstocks (2.3 g) and smallest with
   own roots (2.0 g). Total soluble sugars in harvested fruit were largely
   unaffected by rootstock in most seasons, although taken over all
   seasons, fruit from scions grafted onto Ramsey rootstock had the lowest
   levels, while Teleki 5A had the highest levels (viz. 23.4 degrees Brix
   and 24.7 degrees Brix respectively). Comparative vigour for all seven
   graft combinations was inferred from trunk circumference. There was a
   2-fold difference in rootstock girth below the graft union (viz. 265 nun
   for 1103 Paulsen, compared to 135 mm for S04), whereas differences in
   the scion girth above the graft union were minor (only 16\%). Relative
   compatibility of scion and stock was inferred from `girth ratio' of
   trunk circumference above compared with below the graft union. Girth
   ratio was highest for Sunmuscat scions grafted onto S04 rootstock, and
   lowest for scions on 1103 Paulsen. Scion girth and vine yield were

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Shiraz and Chardonnay grapevines that had been initially assessed for
   Cl- exclusion in the 1996 and 1997 harvest seasons at both Merbein
   (inland region of Victoria) and at Padthaway (sub-coastal region of
   South Australia), were re-evaluated in 2003 and 2004 at those same two
   locations. Both scion varieties were grown either on their own roots or
   were grafted to one of the following rootstocks: Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen,
   140 Ruggeri, K51-40, Schwarzmann, 101-14, Rupestris St George and 1202
   Couderc. Both sites had been irrigated with saline water since 1994. The
   salinity of irrigation water at Merbein was approximately 2.1 dS/m; at
   Padthaway irrigation salinity varied between approximately 1.6 dS/m and
   2.5 dS/m during the survey period. Changes in the Cl--excluding ability
   of all rootstock/scion combinations between 1996, 1997 and 2003, 2004
   were based upon analysis of Cl- concentrations in grape juice and in
   laminae at harvest, as well as Electrical Conductivity (EC), pH and
   Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) of the 1:5 soil:water extract. Taking
   juice Cl- as indicative of rootstock effectiveness for Cl- exclusion,
   and considering data from Merbein, our analyses demonstrated that
   overall means for Shiraz juice Clincreased from around 190 to 427 mg/L
   over the survey period (7 years). In Chardonnay grapevines at Merbein,
   overall mean concentrations of Cl- in juice increased from around 70 to
   around 22 5 mg/L over 7 years. Significant differences between
   rootstocks were evident, with some rootstocks at Merbein showing a
   diminished capacity for Cl- exclusion in 2003 and 2004. By contrast, in
   Padthaway there was no consistent deterioration in Cl--excluding
   capacity by rootstocks supporting either Shiraz or Chardormay as scions.
   In 2004 there were significant differences between grapevines at Merbein
   and Padthaway in the concentration of Cl- accumulated, even though the
   mean soil EC1:5 after harvest for 0-90 cm depth was the same at both
   sites, namely 0.4 dS/m. Containment of grapevine salinity at Padthaway
   (relative to Merbein) between 1996/97 and 2003/04 was most likely due to
   factors such as a lower volume of saline irrigation, double the rainfall
   and 27\% lower pan evaporation.},

   new method of grafting called ``green-grafting{''}, based on the MUMM
   BAP patent and using scions and rootstocks both of herbaceous nature,
   with traditional woody method. The trial was carried out in greenhouse
   during the 2002-2004 period. Factors were grafting method, three grape
   (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars ('Chardonnay', `Cabernet Sauvignon' and
   `Teroldego'), and two rootstocks (Paulsen and Kober 5 BB). Green-grafted
   plants showed a significantly higher percentage of root establishment,
   and lower diameters for scion, graft union and rootstock. Woody-grafted
   vines had higher chlorophyll and carotenoids concentrations, greener
   leaves, and greater dry matter production than green-grafted ones. Net
   photosynthesis, soluble proteins content, and nutritional status did not
   change in relation to the different grafting methods after the second
   year. Glucose and fructose concentrations were higher and plant
   components were better balanced when green-grafting was used. This
   method produced better vascular formation than woody-grafting,
   suggesting more effective transport of substances between stock and
   scion.},

Title = {Genetic diversity analyses of grapevine Rupestris stem
   pitting-associated virus reveal distinct population structures in scion

Abstract = {Grapevine Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV) is a member
   of the genus Foveavirus within the family Flexiviridae. GRSPaV is
   closely associated with the disease Rupestris stem pitting and is
   frequently detected in grapevines worldwide. Previous research in
   several laboratories suggests that GRSPaV consists of a family of
   sequence variants. However, the genetic composition of GRSPaV variants
   in viral isolates from scion and rootstock varieties has not been
   studied extensively. In this report, the genetic diversity and
   population structure of GRSPaV isolates from scion and rootstock
   varieties were analysed using two pairs of primers targeting two
   different genomic regions encoding the helicase domain of the replicase
   and the capsid protein. In total, 190 cDNA clones derived from 24
   isolates were sequenced and analysed. At least four major groups of
   GRSPaV variants were found to exist in grapevines. Interestingly, the
   majority of the scion varieties (9/10) that were analysed, regardless of
   their genetic background and geographical origin, harboured complex
   viral populations composed of two to four distinct viral variants. In
   contrast, the viral populations in isolates from rootstock varieties
   were homogeneous and comprised a single variant. The practice of
   grafting between scion and rootstock varieties commonly used in modern
   viticulture, coupled with the frequent regional and international
   exchange of propagating materials, may have played a major role in the
   ubiquitous distribution and mixed infections of distinct GRSPaV variants
   among scion varieties. The possible origin and evolution of GRSPaV are
   also discussed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effects of some auxins and
   cytokinins on graft union and root formation of grafted cuttings of four
   different grapevine (Vitis vinifera) graft combinations (41B-Erenkoy
   Beyazi, 41B-Italia, Rupestris du Lot-Erenkoy Beyazi, and Rupestris du
   Lot-Italia). The cut grafting surfaces of both the scion and rootstock
   were first dipped into either 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA),
   indole-3-butryic acid (IBA), benzyladenine (BA), or kinetin (Ki) for 20
   s. NAA and IBA were applied at concentrations of 500, 1000, and 2000
   mg/litre and BA and Ki were applied at rates of 250 500. and 1000
   mg/litre. Following this treatment the cuttings were grafted,
   stratified, and hardened. Control group cuttings were grafted without
   any application. Results showed that the physiological effects of
   cytokinins differed from auxins. In general. Ki and BA stimulated rapid
   proliferation of callus between the scion and rootstock whereas NAA and
   IBA increased root formation at the basal end of grafted cuttings
   compared with the control. The best results were obtained from treating
   the raft cut-surfaces of graft combinations with 250 and 500 ma/litre Ki
   or BA. Except for the 1000 mg/litre concentrations, Ki and BA showed
   better callusing rate and callusing degree at grafting point of all
   tested graft combinations compared with the control, whereas rooting
   rate and rooting degree were enhanced by application of IBA and NAA
   compared with the control. In all graft combinations, the highest
   success rate (100\%) was obtained from 250 mg/litre Ki application.
   Significant increases in success rate and callus formation as callusing
   rate and callusing degree at the grafting zone indicated that the Ki and
   BA may have the potential to improve graft union formation.},

Abstract = {Petri disease of grapevine is primarily caused by Phaeomoniella
   chlamydospora. This pathogen affects mostly young grapevines, but is
   also implicated in esca disease of older grapevines. Little is known
   about the disease cycle of this fungus. Infected propagation material
   was identified as a major means of dissemination of the pathogen.
   Recently, the pathogen was also detected from soil in South Africa and
   airborne conidia have been found in vineyards. The aim of this study was
   to use a molecular detection technique to test different samples
   collected from nurseries in South Africa at different nursery stages for
   the presence of P. chlamydospora. A one-tube nested-PCR technique was
   optimised for detecting P. chlamydospora in DNA extracted from soil,
   water, callusing medium and grapevine wood. The one-tube nested-PCR was
   sensitive enough to detect as little as 1 fg of P. chlamydospora genomic
   DNA from water and 10 fg from wood, callusing medium and soil. PCR
   analyses of the different nursery samples revealed the presence of
   several putative 360 bp P. chlamydospora specific bands. Subsequent
   sequence analyses and/or restriction enzyme digestions of all 360 bp PCR
   bands confirmed that all bands were P. chlamydospora specific, except
   for five bands obtained from callusing media and one from water.
   Phaeomoniella chlamydospora was positively detected in 25\% of rootstock
   cane sections collected from mother blocks, 42\% of rootstock cuttings
   and 16\% of scion cuttings collected during grafting, 40\% of water
   samples collected after pre-storage hydration, 67\% of water samples
   collected during grafting, 8\% of callusing medium samples and 17\% of
   soil samples collected from mother blocks. These media can therefore be
   considered as possible inoculum sources of the pathogen during the
   nursery stages.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of fungal grapevine trunk pathogens associated with

   carried out. This study provides evidence for the presence of these

   material production process, nevertheless, P. aleophilum and P.
   chlamydospora were not detected until the rootstock-scion combinations
   were planted in the field to develop shoots and roots during summer. The
   occurrence of trunk disease pathogens in symptomatic young vineyards was
   also high, suggesting that infected plant material might have been used.
   Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and P. aleophilum were the main species
   associated with the decline of young vines, followed by Botryosphaeria
   spp., Cylindrocarpon spp. and B. obtusa. This research confirmed the

Abstract = {Wound protection during all stages of grapevine propagation is of utmost
   importance to prevent infection of propagation material by decline and
   dieback pathogens. In semi-commercial nursery trials, grapevine
   rootstock and scion cuttings were soaked in water (control), chemical or
   biological sanitation products prior to cold storage, prior to grafting
   (machine- or hand-grafting) and prior to planting in field nurseries.
   Natural infection levels in basal ends and graft unions of uprooted
   nursery grapevines were evaluated 8 months after planting. Total
   pathogen incidences in the water-treated control plants ranged from 30\%
   in basal ends to 13.5\% in graft unions. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora was
   the most commonly isolated pathogen, followed by Phaeoacremonium,
   Cylindrocarpon + Campylocarpon, Botryosphaeria and Phomopsis spp.
   Machine-grafted unions generally had lower pathogen incidences compared
   with hand-grafted graft unions. In general, repeated soak-treatments of
   propagation material in the tested products resulted in reduced pathogen
   incidences in nursery grapevines. However, products containing T.
   harzianum (Tricho flow-T), hydrogen peroxide (Bio-sterilizer) and
   8-hydroxyquinoline sulphate (Chinosol) gave inconsistent results,
   whereas Bronocide (a blend of halogenated alcohols and water) proved to
   be a good sterilising agent, but reduced certifiable plant yield
   significantly. Benomyl (at 100 g/100 l), Sporekill (a patented
   didecyldimethylammonium chloride formulation at 150 ml/100 l) and captan
   (at 1000 ml/100 l) were consistently the best treatments as growth
   parameters were not negatively influenced and pathogen incidences in

Abstract = {The use of cutting material infected with Phaeomoniella chlamydospora is
   believed to contribute to Petri disease. Infection levels of own-rooted
   scion, own-rooted rootstock and grafted vines were compared in a

   infection increased over time (53\% and 20\%, respectively, at the

   until the 20-month assessment (22\%). It was concluded that rootstock
   mother-vines are a primary source of the pathogen. The ability of the
   pathogen to move from the retained rootstock mother-vine trunk or head,
   into current season's growthwas investigated by determining disease
   levels in own-rooted rootstock vines propagated from cuttings collected
   at different distances from the head. Vines from dormant cuttings
   collected nearest the head had a higher level of infection at the

Abstract = {Yeast cells have a minimum N requirement to ferment a must through to
   dryness, so that grape N content (hence must N) becomes critical in
   meeting that prerequisite. Viticultural practices aimed at meeting that
   N requirement are of special relevance because interactions between
   rootstock and vineyard nitrogen supply strongly influence scion mineral
   nutrient status as well as shoot vigour, and via those processes, fruit
   composition. Such outcomes were investigated in a field trial involving
   Shiraz on three rootstocks viz. Teleki 5C, Schwarzmann and Ramsey. Five
   N supply regimes, varying from 0 to 80 kg/(ha.season),were imposed
   through a drip-irrigation system during two periods (either flowering to
   veraison, or post-harvest to leaf-fall, or both) over three successive
   growing seasons. Post-harvest N supply increased scion leaf N and
   nitrate N concentrations at flowering for vines on Teleki 5C and
   Schwarzmann. By veraison, N recently applied in the flowering to
   veraison period elevated these indicators of N status in all vines on
   all rootstocks. Grape yields from vines on Teleki 5C and Schwarzmann
   were elevated by N supply after harvest, whereas juice soluble solids
   levels were lowered. Free amino acids in Shiraz juice were dominated by
   non-assimilable N, amounting to about 50\% or more of the total free
   amino-N in the juice. Increasing N supply increased free amino acid
   concentrations in the juice of berries from vines on all rootstocks, but
   only vines on Schwarzmann derived any benefit from N supplied after
   harvest. The highest concentrations of free amino acids were measured in
   the berries from vines on Schwarzmann receiving 80 kg N/(ha.season). Of
   immediate practical relevance for N management of Shiraz grapevines on
   either Teleki 5C or Ramsey rootstocks, the minimum value for assimilable
   free amino-N concentration required to ferment a must through to dryness
   was not achieved if vineyard N application was limited to the
   post-harvest period.},

Abstract = {Methods to manage uncontrolled flow of transgenes via pollen and seeds
   are increasing in importance as transgenic crops become more
   commonplace. In many parts of the world, grapevine scions are grafted
   onto rootstocks, which are adapted to resist adverse soil conditions and
   pests and/or to promote vigor. Water, minerals and other important
   nutrients are transferred in bulk from the rootstock to scion via the
   xylem. Thus, it is possible that bioactive peptides produced by a
   transgenic rootstock and deposited into its xylem sap would be similarly
   transferred to a non-transgenic scion. If the peptide conferred a
   desirable trait to the non-transgenic scion, such as disease resistance,
   the issue of unwanted gene flow would be solved, since transgenic pollen
   and seeds would not be produced during flowering and fruit production.
   Furthermore, the commercialization of transgenic grapevines would be
   simplified, since relatively few transgenic rootstock varieties would be
   needed to protect any non-transgenic scion. As an example, transgenic
   rootstock technology might be used in the control of Pierce's disease
   (PD), which is caused by the xylem-limited bacteria, Xylella fastidiosa.
   Antimicrobial peptides produced by a transgenic rootstock may control
   bacteria in the xylem sap of a non-transgenic scion, thus providing PD
   resistance. To test this hypothesis, transgenic Vitis vinifera `Thompson
   Seedless' expressing the Shiva-1 lytic peptide gene was treated as a
   rootstock. Non-transgenic V. vinifera `Cabernet Sauvignon' and `Thompson
   Seedless' were grafted onto the rootstock. Controls consisted of grafted
   and non-grafted transgenic and non-transgenic vines. Presence of the
   Shiva-1 peptide in xylem sap of the scion was detected by EnzymeLinked
   Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA).},

Abstract = {As demonstrated in many recent researches, grapevine rootstocks may
   affect vigor, water relations, mineral nutrition, fruit yield and
   quality of grapes. In order to better understand the influence of
   scion/rootstock combination on water use and drought resistance some
   water status characteristics were studied on grapevine vines grafted on
   different rootstocks. Old local grapevine variety Vitis vinifera
   `Rebula' or `Ribolla gialla' was grafted on eight rootstocks (196/17
   Castel, 1103 Paulsen, 3309 Couderc, SO4, VI M, V M, Borner, 420 A,
   Rebula 6/28). Biometric characteristics (geometry, dry and fresh weight)
   and the root hydraulic conductivity (RHC) were measured during the
   trial. Midday stem water potential (SWP) was measured five times with a
   Scholander type pressure chamber. 3309 Couderc revealed to be water
   stress sensitive as reported in literature, while 1103 Paulsen which is
   described as high drought resistant did not match the expectations.
   After recovery some of the rootstocks showed an increase in root
   hydraulic conductivity, higher than in unstressed grapevines, thus
   suggesting that it is possible that the degree of suberisation could
   account for the differences in water transport through roots.},

Abstract = {Rapid changing in consumer trends has stimulated new interest for
   variety-replacement techniques in established vineyards. Top-working is
   the process of changing the top of an established vine from one cultivar
   to another in one year, by budding or grafting. Budding techniques as
   Chip-bud or T-bud are very common; not much known is the grafting
   wood-on-green scion (W-green). The aim of this work was to compare
   W-green performance to Chip-bud and T-bud. The top-working was performed
   by skilled workers on a mature vineyard of the Istituto Agrario di San
   Michele a/Adige with scion and bud of `Chardonnay' clone 95. Three
   treatments were imposed on `Cabernet Sauvignon' clone R5 grafted on
   101-14 Mgt rootstock, and on `Syrah' clone 100 and `Merlot' clone 181
   both grafted on 3309 C rootstock. The sprouting yield of grafting type x
   interstock interaction of two-way ANOVA was significant and
   Chip-bud/interstocks resulted significantly higher than T-bud and
   W-green/interstocks with a mean per treatment of 92.0\%, 85.9\% and
   78.6\% respectively. Fertility, production, bunch weight, soluble solid,
   titratable acidity and pH for the three treatments at harvest were not
   significantly different. It was concluded that Chip-bud performed as the

Abstract = {The influence of rootstocks `Saltcreek', `Freedom' and `Harmony' on
   vigor, bud fruitfulness, bud necrosis, fruit yield and quality for table
   grapes (Vilis vinifera L.), was evaluated on the `Perlette', `Flame
   Seedless' and `Sugraone' cultivars. On the rootstocks `Saltcreek' and
   `Freedom' scions induced higher shoot length, pruning weight and shoot
   weight. There was a negative correlation between these variables and bud
   fruitfulness (r=-0.632{*}; r=-0.77{*}; r=0.765{*}). There was a positive
   correlation between bud necrosis and shoot length and pruning weight
   (r=0.743{*}; r=0.572). Bud fruitfulness was lower in all cultivars when
   grafted on `Saltcreek' and `Freedom' than on `Harmony' or on their own
   root. Regressions analyses showed high determination coefficients
   between bud fruitfulness and number of clusters for `Perlette'
   (R-2=0.73) and `Flame Seedless'(R-2 = 0.80), while for `Sugraone' it was
   low (R-2 =0.43). The combinations `Perlette'/'Freedom' and `Flame
   Seedless'/'Freedom' had lower number of clusters per vine, but had more
   cluster length and cluster weight and berries with more diameter than on
   their own root. Rootstocks did not produce any advantage to `Sugraone';
   on the contrary, they delayed harvest, effect that was also found in
   `Perlette' and `Flame Seedless'.},

Abstract = {The potential impact of transgenic plums and grapevines expressing viral
   coat protein (CP) gene constructs on the diversity and dynamics of virus
   populations was assessed under open and confined conditions in the frame
   of a research program sponsored by the European Commission. Across all
   field trials conducted in different locations (France, Romania, and
   Spain) and environments (continental and Mediterranean), transgenic
   plums expressing the CP gene of Plum pox virus (PPV) and transgenic
   grapevines expressing the CP gene of Grapevine Janleaf virus (GFLV) had
   no detectable effect on the emergence of recombinant PPV and GFLV
   species over eight-ten and three years, respectively. Also, no
   statistically significant difference was found in the number and type of
   aphids, including viruliferous individuals, and other arthropods that
   visited transgenic and nontransgenic plum trees. In addition, Apple
   chlorotic leaf spot virus, Prune dwarf virus, and Prunus necrotic
   ringspot virus did not influence the stability of the engineered
   resistance to PPV in co-infected transgenic plums over three dormancy
   periods. Further, under confined conditions, no recombinant virus was
   found to detectable level in transgenic grapevines expressing the CP
   gene of Grapevine virus A (GVA) or Grapevine virus B (GVB) that were
   challenged with the homologous or heterologous virus, despite high
   accumulation of transgene transcripts. Also, translocation of
   transgene-derived products, i.e. protein, mRNAs and siRNAs, did not
   occur to detectable level from transgenic grapevine rootstocks
   expressing the GFLV CP gene to nontransgenic scions. Altogether, our
   transgenic plums and grapevines expressing viral genes had a neutral
   impact on virus populations and non-target organisms over extended time.
   These findings provide new insights into the environmental impact of
   transgenic perennial crops engineered for virus resistance. It is
   expected that they will assist national and international regulatory
   authorities in making scientifically based decisions for the release of
   virus-resistant transgenic crops.},

Abstract = {Aims: The responses of two Vitis vinifera cultivars (Cardinal and
   Superior Seedless) and two rootstocks (110R and SO4) to drought, the
   effect of grafting and the interactions of scion/rootstock were
   investigated.
   Methods and results: The vines were subjected to a progressive water
   stress in greenhouse controlled conditions. At the end of the water
   stress treatments, physiological analyses were carried out (stem water
   potential, dry matter production, soluble sugars, proline as well as
   ions Na+ and K+). Drought was expressed by the drop of the stem water
   potential in the stressed vines as compared to their controls.
   Furthermore, tolerance and sensitivity were linked to the accumulation
   of soluble sugars and proline as well as the equilibrium of K+ and Na+
   in the leaves.
   Conclusion: When ungrafted, Cardinal was more: tolerant to water stress
   than Superior Seedless. The grafted vines exhibited more vigour,
   moreover, the combination of Cardinal with SO4 and Superior Seedless
   with 110R revealed to be the advantageous associations under water
   stress.
   Significance and impact of study: This work has been carried out to
   investigate the differential responses of grapevine cultivars to drought
   stress and the impact of grafting under water shortage conditions.},

Abstract = {In Indian vineyards, some of the rootstocks have been introduced as
   mixtures. 132-56 (resembling to 110R) is one such rootstock, which has
   reached the vineyards as a mixture along with Dog Ridge rootstock, which
   is the ruling rootstock in the Indian vineyards. Earlier the growers and
   scientists in India used to refer to the 132-56 rootstock as `Dog ridge
   A' for the sake of differentiation. At certain locations the vines
   grafted on these rootstocks outperformed those grafted on Dog Ridge
   rootstock in the growers' vineyards particularly those that suffered
   from moisture stress and received saline irrigation. To know the
   potential of 132-56 for use under adverse situations like saline soils,
   the petiole samples of Tas-A-Ganesh from own rooted Vitis vinifera L.
   vines grafted on Dog Ridge (Vitis champini) and on 13256 rootstocks were
   analyzed for sodium and chloride concentrations over three years at six
   different stages of vine growth. The tissue age varied from one month to
   five months. The vines received saline irrigation through drip
   irrigation system. The studies indicated that the grafted vines
   accumulated significantly lower chlorides in the tissues than the own
   rooted vines. The own rooted vines exhibited leaf-burning symptoms. No
   significant differences were observed between the two rootstocks for
   chloride content at any stage of sampling. The vines raised on 132-56
   rootstock accumulated significantly less sodium content than those
   raised on Dog Ridge and own rooted vines at all the stages and years of
   sampling. At two stages, the petioles from vines grafted on Dog Ridge
   rootstock had higher sodium content than own rooted. The vines grafted
   on Dog Ridge rootstock produced higher pruned biomass than the other two
   stock-scion combinations. The results indicated that Dog Ridge, the most
   preferred rootstock introduced by the growers for salinity and drought
   tolerance did not prevent Na from accumulating in the vines to a
   desirable level under saline irrigation. Further the 132-56 rootstock
   exhibited better exclusion for sodium than Dog Ridge.},

Abstract = {The effects of five interspecific hybrid rootstocks on the
   susceptibility of grafted scions to crown gall were studied for six
   years in field as well as greenhouse experiments. The incidence of crown
   gall on susceptible grape scion cultivars (Vitis vinifera cvs. `Thompson
   seedless and `Red Sahebi') was not affected by their grafting onto
   resistant rootstocks, including NAZ(4) (Vitis vinifera cv. `Jighjigha' x
   Riparia Gloire) and NAZ(6) (V.vinifera cv. `Gharaozum' x Kober 5BB), or
   on self-rooted cultivars when the inoculated vines were monitored over a
   three-month period in a greenhouse. The weights of the galls induced on
   non-grafted vines by two of six strains of Agrobacterium vitis and
   Agrobacterium tumefacience biovar 1 were significantly different. A.
   vitis strain AG57 and Agrobacterium tumefacience biovar 1 strain 16/6
   induced significantly larger galls (8.9 and 5.4 mm respectively) on
   `Thompson seedless' and `Red Sahebi' when these were growing as
   self-rooted plants than when grafted on NAZ(4) and NAZ(6). Observations
   over a four-year period in the field showed that there was no difference
   in crown gall incidence until the second year. Scions grafted onto
   rootstocks of NAZ(4) and NAZ(6) had a 21.5\% and 6.8\%, incidence,
   compared to 55\% for self-rooted vines. In another field experiment with
   naturally infected scions of V. vinifera cv. `Asgari' (a very
   susceptible cultivar), crown gall was apparent on vines grafted onto all
   rootstocks after six years. The incidence of crown gall was 18\% on
   NAZ(6) compared to 68\% on NAZ(4). During a five-year period, many
   self-rooted vines died, compared to only a few scions grafted onto
   NAZ(4) and NAZ(6) rootstocks that died. At the end of the study, many

   rootstocks and fertilisation/irrigation treatments. No interaction was
   recorded. The devigorating effect of RGM in comparison to SO4 was
   observed in both experiments, regardless of other parameters.
   Cabernet-Sauvignon was more affected by rootstock than Merlot.
   Conclusion: Rootstock effects on vine vegetative and reproductive
   development were consistently expressed, indicating that scion-rootstock
   interactions are governed not only by adaptative, but also by specific
   physiological traits. Significance and impact of study: This work
   provides information on scion-rootstock interactions which may be useful
   in rootstock breeding programs and may help to better choose the
   rootstock according to the scion and the environment.},

Abstract = {Pecan (Carya illinoinensis) bacterial leaf scorch disease, caused by the
   bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, causes leaf loss and reduction in yield of
   pecans. One of the ways that the pathogen infects newly developing trees
   is by graft-transmission through infected scion wood. Submersion of
   pecan scion wood in 46 degrees C water for 30 min greatly reduced
   transmission of X. fastidiosa following grafting. During a 2-year study
   with potted rootstock grafted to either hot-water treated or nontreated
   scion wood collected from limbs of `Cape Fear' pecan infected with X.
   fastidiosa, the pathogen was detected in 21\% of the trees that
   developed from the nontreated scion wood and 0.7\% of the trees from the
   hot-water-treated scions. The hot-water treatment of 46 degrees C for 30
   min did not affect graft success. Likewise, scion diameter had no effect
   on success of grafting or on the efficacy of hot-water treatment.
   Similar hot-water treatments have been efficacious in elimination of X.
   fastidiosa and some other pathogens from grapevine cuttings. The use of
   the hot-water treatment demonstrated in this report could be helpful to
   individual pecan growers and nurseries that use scion wood that may be
   infected with X. fastidiosa to reduce the occurrence of pecan bacterial
   leaf scorch disease in new trees.},

Abstract = {The effects of two rootstocks (1103P and SO4) on water status, gas
   exchange, leaf structural characteristics and vine growth were studied
   in a factorial experiment over 2 years (2005-2006), in field-grown
   grapevines of cv. Cabernet-Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera L), subjected to
   three irrigation levels (FI: 100\% of evapotranspiration, DI: 50\% of
   evapotranspiration and NI: not irrigated). The experiment was conducted
   on 10-year-old vines, grown under the semi-arid conditions of central
   Greece. There was a significant depressive effect in water status
   (estimated by midday stem water potential, Psi(s)) and net assimilation
   rate (A) of Cabernet-Sauvignon with decreasing water supply, on both
   rootstocks. The down regulation of A was mainly due to decreases in
   stomatal conductance (g(s)). NI treatment showed significantly higher
   intrinsic water use efficiency (A/g(s)) and lower leaf carbon isotope
   discrimination (Delta) compared to irrigated treatments. Leaf area index
   (LAI) and pruning weight (PW) were found to be higher under FI treatment
   but this effect was more pronounced on the 1103P-grafted vines. Canopy
   growth was strongly controlled by rootstock, being significantly higher
   on 1103P, presumably due to its higher capacity to access soil water.
   Rootstock genotype affected scion water status via its effect on
   whole-vine transpiration. Cabernet-Sauvignon photosynthesis response to
   water status was not altered by rootstock. The only apparent difference
   between rootstocks was the higher A of SO4-grafted vines under NI
   treatment, associated with higher Psi(s). A/g(s) and Delta were only
   altered under FI treatment, with 1103P showing more efficient use of
   available soil water than SO4. Vines on SO4 had a lower specific leaf
   area (SLA) as a result of lower growth rate than 1103P,which possibly
   provided a supplemental mechanism to maintain leaf water status and gas
   exchange.
   Concluding, SO4 could be better adapted on fertile soils under
   non-limiting water supply due to its capacity to achieve a balanced
   vegetative and reproductive growth while 1103P, a more water efficient
   rootstock, would be better to grow in semi-arid regions where water
   limitation occurs. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is one of the most devastating disease in
   areas where sweet orange or grapefruit are budded onto sour orange
   rootstock. In Texas, the citrus industry is located in the far south of
   the state in a high pH and calcareous soils region, which makes sour
   orange the best rootstock option. The Texas industry has been under a
   threat since the arrival in Florida and Mexico of the most efficient
   vector of CTV, the Brown Citrus Aphid. In an attempt to find a suitable
   replacement for sour orange rootstock a field trial was performed to
   evaluate 10 rootstocks with Rio Red grapefruit scion. Trees on C35 and
   Carrizo citranges, and Swingle citrumelo became very chlorotic and died.
   The other rootstocks also showed slight to severe chlorosis but were
   able to recover. C22 outperformed all rootstocks during the 6 years,
   producing more than 1.5 times the yield of sour orange, and approximate
   to 2-fold the production of Goutou which was the rootstock with the
   lowest production. Although significantly lower than C22, the cumulative
   production of trees on C57 and C146 rootstocks were excellent and their
   yearly fruit productions were similar to that of C22 in four (2001,
   2003, 2004, and 2005) out of the 6 years of study. All three rootstocks
   originated from the same cross (Sunki mandarin x Swingle trifoliate
   orange). In all years, sour orange rootstock yielded the highest
   percentage of soluble solids (SS) and Troyer and Goutou rootstocks the
   lowest. Although the SS varied with rootstocks, the ratio of the SS and
   the percentage of acid did not significantly vary with rootstock type.
   Considering that C22, C57, and C146 are tolerant to CTV and other
   important diseases, these rootstocks are good options to replace Sour
   orange in Texas.},

Abstract = {Although the inland Pacific Northwest has a warm climate during the
   growing season, grapes grown in this region may be exposed to colder
   than optimal temperatures at several times during the year. In addition
   to damage from spring and fall frosts, intermittent winters with little
   to no snow cover and subzero temperatures can cause vine dieback and
   death. Temperature patterns in the recent past indicate that both fall
   and midwinter are times when risk of bud damage from cold events is
   probable, making proper site selection and cultivar choice critical.
   Water is not used for frost protection in this climate, but wind
   machines have proven to be useful. In frost-prone sites, annual sucker
   growth with cane burying is practiced as an insurance strategy.
   Modifying pruning strategies has not been shown to be advantageous after
   fall cold events. If rootstocks are used, research has shown greater
   scion survival with higher graft positions.},

Abstract = {The efficacy of cross-protection at mitigating the impact of Grapevine
   fanleaf virus (GFLV) on grapevines (Vitis vinifera) was assessed in two
   naturally infected vineyard sites. Test vines consisted of scions
   grafted onto rootstocks that were healthy or infected by mild protective
   strains GFLV-GHu or Arabis mosaic Writs (ArMV)-Ta. Challenge GFLV
   infection via the nematode Xiphinema index was monitored over nine
   consecutive years in control and ArMV-Ta cross-protected vines by
   double-antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using
   GFLV-specific antibodies, and in GFLV-GHu cross-protected vines by
   characterizing the coat protein gene of superinfecting isolates by
   immunocapture-reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results were
   consistent with a significantly reduced challenge infection rate in
   cross-protected vines compared with control vines, more so in those
   protected with GFLV-GHu (19 versus 90\%) than with ArMV-Ta (40 versus
   65\% in field A and 63 versus 90\% in field 13). However, the two mild
   strains significantly reduced fruit yield by 9\% (ArMV-Ta) and 17\%
   (GFLV-GHu) over 8 years and had a limited effect on fruit quality.
   Therefore, in spite of a great potential at reducing the incidence of
   challenge field isolates, cross-protection with natural mild protective
   strains GFLV-GHu and ArMV-Ta is not attractive to control GFLV because
   the negative impact on yield is a limiting factor for its deployment.},

Abstract = {In Citrus, the success of the scion largely depends upon the rootstock
   on which it has been grafted. `Troyer' citrange is an important
   rootstock used worldwide for high density planting. It is also one of
   the most promising rootstock for several Indian scion varieties such as
   `Nagpur' mandarin, `Kinnow' mandarin, grapefruits, acid lime, `Satsuma'
   sweet orange and `Mosambi' sweet orange. In addition, it has high
   resistance to tristeza virus, which causes Citrus decline, and has good
   adaptability for acidic soil. Commercial rootstock cultivars are
   commonly propagated by seeds. However, seeds of many Citrus varieties
   are moderately recalcitrant and also face loss of viability within a
   short period. The plants grown from seeds exhibit extended juvenility (4
   to 10 years), thus making vegetative propagation and micropropagation a
   desirable method of propagation. The present study focuses on developing
   an efficient micropropagation protocol for the production of clonally
   uniform plants through axillary branching method of slow growing
   rootstock variety, `Troyer' citrange. Multiple shoots can be obtained
   from single nodes of field grown trees cultured on Murashige and Skoog's
   (MS; 1962) medium containing Benzylamino purine (BA; 1.11 mu M), Kinetin
   (Kn; 1.1625 mu M), and 3\% sucrose. A shoot multiplication fold of 3.86
   every four weeks was achieved. Proliferated shoots were rooted on half
   strength MS medium with Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA; 0.5 mu M) and
   plantlets were transferred to a mixture of soil and agropeat. 100\%
   survival was observed during hardening of the rooted plantlets. The
   comparative analyses of the DNA fingerprinting profiles confirmed the
   genetic stability of the regenerated plantlets. The results of this
   study have enormous commercial application for the propagation of
   healthy disease-free Citrus rootstocks to meet the ever-growing demand
   for superior quality planting material.},

   realized by advanced custom DNA microarrays using `Riesling', a
   phylloxera-sensitive scion, as a control. IAA induction resulted in
   higher numbers of differentially expressed genes in `Borner' than in
   `Riesling'. In total, 27 putative HR-related genes were identified in
   `Borner'. These genes are presumably involved in the production of
   phytoalexins, ethylene-associated gene products, cell wall proteins and

Abstract = {Florida's citrus industry is currently under severe onslaught from two
   non-indigenous but now endemic pathogens causing the diseases
   huanglongbing (HLB) and citrus canker. None of the commercial cultivars
   are resistant to either disease, which result in severe losses to the
   industry. Genetic transformation of citrus, to incorporate gene(s) for
   disease resistance not found in citrus, is gaining importance due to the
   possibility of incorporating resistance to these diseases. In an effort
   to transform a large number of cultivars via Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation, epicotyl explants of several citrus scion and rootstock
   cultivars were evaluated for their ability to incorporate transgenes
   into their genome. It was determined that genetic transformation
   efficiency depended on cultivar studied, and the cultivars were either
   relatively easy to transform, moderately difficult, or recalcitrant to
   Agrobacterium infection. In general, of the cultivars investigated,
   Carrizo and `Duncan' had the highest transformation efficiency (over
   40\%), followed by `OLL8', a `Valencia' like somaclone, and `Hamlin'
   (20\% to 40\%). Poncirus trifoliata, `Marsh' and `Flame' grapefruit, and
   `Valencia' sweet orange were moderately difficult (10\% to 20\%), while
   `Mexican Lime', `Volkamer' lemon, Citrus macrophylla, and tangerines
   were recalcitrant (less than 10\%). Our results also suggested that
   final recovery rate of transgenic plants suitable for transfer to a
   greenhouse were significantly lower than the total transgenic plants
   obtained after transformation since the cultivars also varied in their
   ability to regenerate after in vitro grafting.},

Abstract = {Some of the 10 known grapevine leafroll associated viruses (GLRaVs) have
   negative impacts upon vine productivity and grape quality, though these
   negative influences are dependent on factors Such as GLRaV strain,
   cultivar, clone, rootstock, and vine age. This is the first study to
   report on GLRaV-2 and GLRaV-3 infected vines, with regard to phenolic
   compounds, and other fruit maturity indices, of `Pinot noir' grapes,
   compared to berries from adjacent vines free of GLRaVs (same vineyards).
   Three different rootstock/scion combinations were included in this
   study. Clusters were collected for two growing seasons from commercial
   vineyards in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, and each vine sampled was
   tested for GLRaV-1, -2, -3 and Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus
   (RSPaV). All sampled vines were infected with RSPaV. Grapevine leafroll
   associated virus-infected vines tested positive for GLRaV-2 or GLRaV-3.
   Overall, fruit infected with GLRaV-2 and -3 had reduced percent soluble
   solids, decreased individual and total anthocyanins, and increased skin
   and pulp weight for all three `Pinot noir' rootstock/sci on combinations
   examined. Vitis riparia rootstock/'Pinot noir' clone 114 scion
   combination appeared to be the most sensitive to GLRaV-3 infection,
   having significant reduction of all five anthocyanins, total phenolics,
   and total tannins, with an increased cluster weight and 100-berry
   weight. No clear trends were observed in the polyphenolics analysed.

Abstract = {Rootstocks (41 B Mgt., 140 Ruggeri, 161-49 Couderc, 1103 Paulsen and 110
   Richter) and scion/rootstock combinations (Bobal/1103 P, Merlot/110 R,
   Tempranillo/110 R and Tempranillo/161-49 C) were hot-water treated
   (HWTed) at 50, 51, 52. 53, or 54 degrees C for three periods: 30, 45 or
   60 min. Four groups of 10 cuttings were treated for each temperature and
   time, and four additional groups of 10 untreated cuttings were prepared
   as controls. At the end of the growing season, cutting sprouting and
   shoot weight were evaluated. In a second experiment, healthy cuttings of
   `110 R' rootstock were vacuum-inoculated with conidial suspensions
   (10(6) conidia mL(-1)) of one isolate of either Phaeomoniella
   chlamydospora or Phaeoacremonium aleophilum. These cuttings were
   subjected to the treatments indicated above. Four groups of 10 cuttings
   were treated for each temperature, time and isolate, with their
   respective controls. Isolations were made immediately after the
   treatments and at the end of the growing season, when cutting sprouting
   and shoot weight were evaluated. Results demonstrated that it is
   possible to hot-water treat grapevine planting material in Spanish
   nurseries using protocols with temperatures of up to 50 degrees C. HWTs
   at 53 degrees C are able to eliminate Pa. chlamydospora completely and
   Strongly reduce the re-isolation of Pm. aleophilum from grapevine wood.
   These findings will contribute to the development of an effective
   control for Petri disease in grapevine propagating material in Spanish
   grapevine nurseries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Previous surveys conducted in commercial nurseries found that different
   wood fungi, namely Cylindrocarpon spp., Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis
   viticola and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora infect grapevine cuttings. Two
   field trials were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of
   cyprodinil + fludioxonil, pyraclostrobin + metiram, fludioxonil and
   cyprodinil to prevent or reduce natural infections caused by such fungi.
   Rootstock and scion cuttings were soaked in fungicidal suspensions for
   50 min prior to grafting. After callusing, the grafted cuttings were
   planted in two commercial field nurseries with and without a previous
   history of grapevine cultivation. After nine months in the nursery, the
   plants were uprooted and analysed for the incidence and severity of the
   wood fungi. Plants uprooted from the field without a previous history of
   grapevine cultivation were generally less strongly infected by wood
   fungi. Under this condition, only the mixture cyprodinil + fludioxonil
   simultaneously reduced the incidence of Cylindrocarpon and
   Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, as well as the severity of Cylindrocarpon
   infections. Treatments did not produce significant differences in the
   incidence and severity of P. viticola, and Pa. chlamydospora. For plants
   grown in the field with a grapevine history, all fungicides except
   cyprodinil significantly reduced the incidence and severity of
   Cylindrocarpon fungi. Also, the incidence and severity of
   Botryosphaeriaceae pathogens were significantly decreased both by
   cyprodinil + fludioxonil and by cyprodinil. No significant differences
   were noticed for P. viticola incidence and severity, and Pa.
   chlamydospora was not, detected again. These results suggest that the
   practice of soaking grapevine cuttings in selected fungicides prior to
   grafting significantly reduces Cylindrocarpon spp. and
   Botryosphaeriaceae infections, thus improving the quality of planting
   material.},

Journal = {TRANSGENIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Grapevine virus A (GVA) is closely associated with the economically
   important rugose-wood disease of grapevine. In an attempt to develop GVA
   resistance, we made a GFP-tagged GVA-minireplicon and utilized it as a
   tool to consistently activate RNA silencing. Launching the
   GVA-minireplicon by agroinfiltration delivery resulted in a strong RNA
   silencing response. In light of this finding, we produced transgenic
   Nicotiana benthamiana plants expressing the GVA-minireplicon, which
   displayed phenotypes that could be attributed to reproducibly and
   consistently activate post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). These
   included: (i) low accumulation of the minireplicon-derived transgene;
   (ii) low GFP expression that was increased upon agroinfiltration
   delivery of viral suppressors of silencing; and (iii) resistance against
   GVA infection, which was found in 60\%, and in 90-95\%, of T1 and T2
   progenies, respectively. A grafting assay revealed that non-silenced
   scions exhibited GVA resistance when they were grafted onto silenced
   rootstocks, suggesting transmission of RNA silencing from silenced
   rootstocks to non-silenced scions. Despite being extremely resistant to
   GVA infection, the transgenic plants were susceptible to the closely
   related vitivirus, GVB. Furthermore, infection of the silenced plants
   with GVB or Potato virus Y (PVY) resulted in suppression of the
   GVA-specific defense. From these data we conclude that
   GVA-minireplicon-mediated RNA silencing provides an important and
   efficient approach for consistent activation of PTGS that can be used
   for controlling grapevine viruses. However, application of this strategy
   for virus resistance necessitates consideration of possible infection by
   other viruses.},

Abstract = {There is an increased demand for high quality winegrapes in the Sao
   Francisco Valley, a new wine producing area in Brazil. As the grape
   quality is closely linked to the soil water status, understanding the
   effects of rootstock and irrigation management on grapevine water
   relations is essential to optimize yield and quality. This study was
   carried out to investigate the effects of irrigation strategies and
   rootstocks on water relations and scion vigour of field-grown grapevines
   in Petrolina, Pernambuco state, Brazil. The cultivars used as scions are
   Moscato Canelli and Syrah, both grafted onto IAC 572 and 1103 Paulsen
   rootstocks. The following water treatments were used: deficit
   irrigation, with holding water after veraison; and partial root-zone
   drying, Supplying (100\% of crop evapotranspiration) of the water loss
   to only one side of the root system after fruit set, alternating the
   sides periodically (about 24 days). In general, all treatments had
   values of pre-dawn leaf water potential higher than -0.2 MPa, suggesting
   absence of water stress. The vine water status was more affected by
   rootstock type than irrigation strategies. Both cultivars grafted on IAC
   572 had the highest values of midday leaf water potential and stem water
   potential, measured on non-transpiring leaves, which were bagged with
   both plastic sheet and aluminum foil at least I h before measurements.
   For both cultivars, the stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (E)
   and leaf area index (LAI) were also more affected by roostsotck type
   than by irrigation strategies. The IAC 572 rootstock presented higher
   g(s), E and LAI than the 1103 Paulsen. Differences in vegetative vigor
   of the scion grafted onto IAC 572 rootstocks were related to its higher
   leaf specific hydraulic conductance and deeper root system as compared
   to the 1103 Paulsen, which increased the water-extraction capability,
   resulting in a better vine water status.},

Abstract = {Compositional changes of skin and seed phenolic compounds and berry
   glycosylated aroma precursors were measured in Vitis vinifera L. cv.
   Cabernet Sauvignon onto 1103P and SO4 rootstocks, in three irrigation
   regimes (FI, 100\% of evapotranspiration; DI, 50\% of
   evapotranspiration; and NI, non-irrigated). The study was conducted in a
   commercial vineyard of central Greece, in a factorial experiment during
   two growing seasons (2005-2006). Grape samples were obtained at
   commercial harvest. The deficit water supply decreased berry size but
   did not affect the skin/pulp weight ratio. Water limitation, especially
   pre-veraison, caused a substantial increase of skin anthocyanin
   concentration, and this effect was independent of water deficit-induced
   reductions in berry size and vine vigor. Among individual anthocyanins,
   malvidin-3-O-glucoside was mostly affected by water supply. The
   rootstock genotype did not affect berry growth parameters and skin
   polyphenol concentrations. The irrigation regime (mainly post-veraison)
   and rootstock genotype affected total flavan-3-ol monomers in seed
   tissue, mainly as a result of variations in the catechin amount. The
   lower seed phenolic concentration was found in non-irrigated and
   SO4-grafted vines, probably as a result of the restriction of scion
   vigor caused by these treatments, thereby altering cluster exposure.
   Skin and seed tannins were not affected by either rootstock or
   irrigation. The limited water supply was associated with increased aroma
   potential at harvest.},

   tolerance of Tempranillo decreased along the study period. Tempranillo
   excluded Cl and, in particular, Na from the leaves more efficiently than

Abstract = {Background and Aims: Rootstocks influence the inorganic ion and organic
   acid composition of grapes of the scion variety. The aim was to
   investigate the impact of rootstocks on the inter-relationship of
   inorganic ions and organic acid anions in the skin and pulp of grapes
   and in resultant wine.
   Methods and Results: Vines were irrigated with water having electrical
   conductivities in the range 1.6-2.1 dS/m. Chloride, sodium, potassium,
   malic and tartaric acid concentrations were higher in almost all cases
   in skin than in pulp. Significant positive correlations existed between
   chloride and sodium concentrations in both pulp and skin. A significant
   negative linear regression existed between malic acid and both chloride
   and sodium concentrations in skin of Chardonnay berries. There were
   positive linear regressions in chloride concentration between berry
   (pulp and skin) and resultant wine chloride in both Chardonnay and
   Shiraz.
   Conclusion: The higher malic acid and lower chloride concentrations in
   skin of most grafted Chardonnay and Shiraz vines, and vice versa for own
   rooted vines, may indicate competition for similar transporter proteins
   involved in loading into skins. Alternatively, higher salt
   concentrations in skins may be associated with accelerated malic acid
   catabolism.
   Significance of the Study: Chloride-excluding rootstocks demonstrated
   advantages through reduced chloride (but not sodium) in pulp and skin of
   grape berries and in resultant wines. Where rootstocks reduced chloride
   concentrations in skin of grape berries, there is potential for higher
   malic acid in skin and in the resultant red wines.},

Title = {Impact of rootstock on yield and ion concentrations in petioles, juice

   with different irrigation water salinity},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {243-257},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: Within-site comparisons were made of rootstock
   effects on yield, and chloride and sodium concentrations in petioles,
   juice and wine of Shiraz and Chardonnay vines at sites with irrigation
   water salinities (ECiw) ranging from low (0.4 dS/m) to moderate-high
   (1.8 to 3.3 dS/m). It also compared consistency of yield performance of
   the various rootstocks with both scions over 8 years at one site with an
   ECiw of 2.1 dS/m.
   Methods and Results: Chardonnay and Shiraz on own roots and on Ramsey,
   1103 Paulsen, 140 Ruggeri, K51-40, Schwarzmann, 101-14, Rupestris St.
   George and 1202 Couderc were compared. Ramsey resulted in better yields
   relative to most of the other rootstocks at three of the four sites for
   each scion. Exceptions were the low salinity site where Schwarzmann was
   best with Chardonnay, and Padthaway where 140 Ruggeri was best with
   Shiraz. Chardonnay wine chloride concentrations were similar to grape
   juice chloride concentrations, but Shiraz wine chloride concentrations
   were on average 1.7-fold higher than grape juice chloride.
   Conclusions: Shiraz on own roots, K51-40 and 1202C rootstocks carry some
   risk of accumulating unacceptable levels of chloride in grape juice and
   wine when the salinity of the irrigation water is at moderate to high
   levels. Rootstocks K51-40 (with Chardonnay and Shiraz) and potentially
   101-14 (with Shiraz) should be avoided in situations of long term
   irrigation with moderate to high salinity water.
   Significance of the Study: The study identifies rootstocks with
   acceptable yields and grape juice chloride concentrations for potential
   use in regions affected by salinity.},

Title = {Scion genotype controls biomass allocation and root development in
   grafted grapevine},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {290-300},
Abstract = {Background and Aims:
   Grafting is used in viticulture worldwide. Rootstocks are known to alter
   scion development or `confer vigour' to varying degrees. This work
   examines scion/rootstock interactions in young grafted grapevines. Its
   aim was to determine the effects of scion and rootstock genotypes on
   biomass allocation within the plant.
   Methods and Results:
   Five months after grafting, biomass allocation between the root and the
   shoot was measured for all the scion/rootstock combinations made between
   three Vitis genotypes. The scion genotype explained the highest
   percentage of the non-random variance for biomass allocation within the
   plant, including biomass allocation to the roots, i.e. it conferred
   differences in root vigour. In addition, we developed a double-grafted
   system, in which a single scion was grafted onto two rootstocks, to
   analyse further scion (or carbon source) effects on root development.
   Conclusions:
   This work provides evidence of conferred root vigour by the scion which
   does not appear to be related to carbon supply from the shoot. The
   genotypes studied display varying levels of plasticity in their response
   to different grafting partners.
   Significance of the Study:
   This work presents detailed analysis of biomass allocation within young
   grafted vines. In young grafted grapevines, the scion genotype has a
   major effect on most parameters of development, especially in the root.
   This aspect of rootstock/scion interactions should be taken into account
   when selecting rootstocks. A double-grafting system was developed for
   future research on signalling pathways and exchange mechanisms between
   scion and rootstock in grafted grapevine.},

Abstract = {Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV; genus
   Foveavirus, family Flexiviridae) is present in many grape-growing
   regions of the world. A total of 84 full-length coat protein (CP)
   sequences and 57 sequences representing the helicase-encoding region
   (HR) of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were obtained from wine grape
   cultivars grown in the Pacific North-West (PNW) of the United States and
   their molecular diversity was compared with corresponding sequences
   previously reported from other grape-growing regions. In pairwise
   comparisons, the CP sequences from PNW isolates showed identities
   between 80 and 100\% at the nucleotide level and the HR sequences showed
   identities between 79 and 100\%. A global phylogenetic analysis of the
   CP and HR sequences revealed segregation of GRSPaV isolates into four
   major lineages with isolates from PNW distributed in all four lineages,
   indicating a lack of clustering by geographical origin. Scion cultivars
   grafted onto rootstock were found to contain mixtures of more genetic
   variants belonging to different lineages than own-rooted cultivars.
   Assessment of population genetic parameters found that the CP was more
   variable than the HR region. The discordant gene phylogenies obtained
   for some CP and HR sequences and the identification of potential
   recombination events involving parents from different lineages provided
   strong evolutionary evidence for genetic diversity among GRSPaV
   isolates. These results underscore the highly variable nature of the
   virus with implications for grapevine health status and distribution of
   virus-tested planting materials. This study also contributes to an
   increased understanding of molecular population genetics of viruses
   infecting deciduous woody perennials.},

Abstract = {`US Early Pride' is an early season, seedless mandarin developed and
   recently released by the USDA, ARS. `US Early Pride' resulted from
   irradiated budwood of `Fallglo' mandarin in 1991. Trees were produced
   from the irradiated budwood and planted into the field in 1992. In 1995
   a seedless mutant (USDA 1-62-122) was identified and subsequently
   propagated on multiple rootstocks for evaluation. Based upon
   horticultural performance of the USDA 1-62-122 trees a nd fruit quality
   characteristics, especially the absence of seeds, USDA 1-62-122 was
   released in 2009 as `US Early Pride'. Although `US Early Pride' has been
   found to he essentially identical to `Fallglo' with the exception of
   being seedless, detailed studies to document time of maturity and
   postharvest behavior had not been conducted prior to release. We
   harvested `US Early Pride' and `Fallglo' fruit at intervals from October
   through late November and standard fruit quality parameters (size,
   weight, rind color, total soluble solids, (Brix) and titratable acidity)
   were quantified for both scions. Data indicate that `US Early Pride'
   fruit are slightly smaller than `Fallglo'. `US Early Pride' and
   `Fallglo' fruit were both legally mature in early October and maintained
   acceptable quality on the tree at least until late November. Following
   harvest, the response to ethylene was similar in `US Early Pride' and
   `Fallglo'. Sugars and acids were fairly consistent in the two cultivars
   during storage at 10 degrees C for 3 weeks. Decay and other postharvest
   disorders did not develop in either cultivar during storage. Our results
   document that `US Early Pride' is equivalent to `Fallglo' in time of
   maturity, response to ethylene, and postharvest behavior.},

Title = {Influence of Rootstocks on Growth Yield and Fruit Composition of
   Thompson Seedless Grapes Grown in the Pune Region of India},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-8},
Abstract = {The use of rootstocks is gaining importance in Indian viticulture due to
   problems associated with abiotic stresses, such as drought and salinity,
   and also to improve scion characteristics. Thompson Seedless is the only
   commercial cultivar grown for both fresh consumption and raisin making.
   Dog Ridge was the only popular rootstock used by grape growers prior to
   late 1990s. But this rootstock was known to induce more vigour in
   scions, resulting in reduced bud fruitfulness and thereby fruit yield.
   To identify alternate rootstocks suitable for Thompson Seedless, a study
   was initiated in the National Research Centre for Grapes, Pune, India
   during the year 2001. Five rootstocks with own rooted vines were
   evaluated in this study. During the initial years, Thompson Seedless
   grafted on Dog Ridge produced the highest yield, with good quality
   fruit. Over the years we could observe uneven bud sprouting, gaps on the
   cordon due to dead wood formation, and reduced yield in vines grafted on
   Dog Ridge rootstocks. In contrast, Thompson Seedless grafted on 110R
   performed well in terms of moderate vigour, increased fruitfulness and
   consistently higher yield. Dog Ridge and St. George produced a lower
   yield, owing to increased vigour measured in terms of pruning weight,
   total shoot length and cane diameter. Rootstocks 110R, 1103P and 99R are
   also known to increase water-use efficiency during critical growth
   stages of fruit bud differentiation and full bloom. No significant
   influence of rootstocks was observed for most of the fruit composition
   parameters. Larger and bolder berries were produced on Dog ridge and
   110R rootstock, while they were the smallest on own rooted vines.},

   Conversely, cane masses increased progressively with lime application
   rate, with L1 exceeding L0 by 11.0\% and L2 exceeding L1 by 13.0\%.
   These increases were significant. Compared to L0, liming decreased the
   ratio of yield to cane mass by 13.6\% in L1 and 28.8\% in L2, but
   increased Ca:Mg ratios in the soil and petioles. Wine quality was
   significantly better from L0 than L2. Petiole N concentrations were
   above normal in all treatments. Suppressed yields and wine quality in

Abstract = {The concentration of potassium (K) in scions call be controlled by
   rootstocks (Vitis). However, differences between rootstocks in the
   accumulation of K and mechanisms of regulation of K, when rootstocks are
   grafted to a scion, are not clearly understood. Therefore, the current
   study addresses these issues. Rootstocks Freedom, Schwarzmann, Ramsey,
   1103 Paulsen, 110 Richter, 140 Ruggeri and 101-14 were grafted with
   `Shiraz' and grown in sand for 56 days in a glasshouse, with daily
   watering using solutions containing 3 mM K. At day 56, Freedom had
   highest total K uptake. Freedom and 101-14 had the highest and 140
   Ruggeri the lowest concentration of K respectively, in shoot and roots.
   Accumulation of K in grapevine is affected by the interaction between
   rootstock and scion, with total K uptake increasing with total root
   length, total root surface area and percentage of roots ill small
   diameter class (<0.5 mm). Accumulation of K in the whole grapevine or in

Abstract = {Two field experiments with `Valencia' sweet orange {[}Citrus sinensis
   (L.) Osb.] trees propagated on 12 rootstocks were conducted in
   commercial orchards. The objectives were to compare rootstock
   horticultural performance between two locations with soils
   representative of the Central Florida Ridge (AP) and coastal Hatwoods
   (I), the major citrus-growing regions in Florida, and to see if
   financial analysis would provide an improved basis for interpreting
   rootstock performance. The randomized complete-block trials involved
   six-tree plots replicated eight or 10 times at planting densities of 358
   trees (AP) or 252 trees (I)/ha, respectively. Tree growth and survival,
   yield, and juice quality were measured for 15 years. When losses
   occurred, trees were replaced annually with another one on the same
   rootstock. The data of seven rootstocks were subjected to a financial
   interpretation of three scenarios: tree loss and tree loss with or
   without tree replacement using the discounted cash flow and internal
   rate of return methods at a 15\% rate. At the flatwoods location, when
   differences among replications became apparent on several rootstocks,
   soil data were collected to study its possible association to tree
   performance; also in this trial, 400-kg fruit samples were
   differentially harvested in 2 successive years from mature trees on each
   of five commercial rootstocks when the juice soluble solids/acid ratio
   was near 15. The juice was extracted, pasteurized, and evaluated for
   flavor by an experienced taste panel. The horticultural data obtained
   for trees on specific well-studied rootstocks {[}Volkamer (C.
   volkameriana Ten. \& Pasq.)] and rough (C. jambhiri Lush.) lemons,
   Carrizo citrange {[}C. sinensis x Poncirus tripliata (L.)], sour orange
   {[}C. aurantium (L.)], Cleopatra mandarin (C. reshni Hort. ex Tan.),
   trifoliate orange (P. trifoliata), a selection of sweet orange (C.
   silicosis), and Swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi Macf. x P. trifoliata) at
   both locations were typical of their well-documented performance in
   Florida and elsewhere. Tree losses were virtually only from citrus
   blight and ranged from none (sour orange) to greater than 50\% (Volkamer
   and rough lemons) at both locations, although tree loss began later at
   the Central Florida location. `Valencia' cuttings (only at the flatwoods
   site) were long-lived and cropped well for their smaller size compared
   with the budded trees. Taste panelists were not able to distinguish
   differences over two seasons among pasteurized `Valencia' juices
   produced from trees on different rootstocks and normalized by soluble
   solids/acid ratio. Yield and planting density were the main factors
   affecting financial outcome; also, in the highly variable soils of the
   coastal Hatwoods, trees growing in sites with greater depth to an
   argillic layer had 30\% to 200\% higher yields. Trees on Volkamer lemon
   had only approximate to 50\% survival at both locations but had the
   highest (\$7,338/ha I) or one of the highest cash flows (\$13,464/ha AP)
   as compared with one of the commercial standards, Carrizo citrange
   (\$6,928 I; \$16,826 AP), which had only approximate to 25\% tree loss.
   Inclusion of financial analysis, with certain limitations, was concluded
   to considerably improve rootstock selection decisions compared with
   selection based only on horticultural data.},

Title = {Rootstocks and the Performance and Economic Returns of `Hamlin' Sweet
   Orange Trees},

Abstract = {`Hamlin' is a principal sweet orange grown in Florida for processing. It
   is productive but produces juice with low soluble solids content and
   poor color. A long-term trial was conducted in central Florida to
   determine rootstock effects on yield and juice quality and the effect of
   economic analysis on the interpretation of the horticultural results.
   The trees were a commonly used commercial selection of `Hamlin' sweet
   orange {[}Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.] propagated on 19 rootstocks planted
   in a randomized complete block design of three-tree plots with six
   replicates in a Spodosol soil at a density of 350 trees/ha. Routine
   horticultural data were collected from the original trial (H1) for 10
   years. Trees on some rootstocks that grew and yielded poorly were
   removed within a few years and replaced with a second trial (H2) with 13
   rootstocks from which data were collected for 5 years. The H1 data were
   financially analyzed to compare the relative usefulness of horticultural
   and economic data in interpreting results and making rootstock
   decisions. In H1 after 10 years, tree height ranged from greater than 5
   m {[}Volkamer lemon (C. volkameriana Ten. \& Pasq.)] and Cleopatra
   mandarin (C. reshni Hort. ex Tan.) to 2.4 m \{Flying Dragon trifoliate
   orange {[}Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.]\}. In H2, the trees on somatic
   hybrid rootstocks were approximate to 2 m tall after 8 years and 4.4 m
   among those on mandarins and C-32 citrange (C. sinensis x P.
   trifoliata). Tree losses from citrus blight were generally low except
   for the trees on Carrizo and Troyer citranges (greater than 50\%).
   Horticulturally, the highest performing trees in H1, measured by
   cumulative yield and soluble solids production over 10 years, were those
   on Carrizo, Troyer, and Benton citranges; poor performers were those on
   Smooth Flat Seville and Kinkoji (putative sour orange hybrids). Fruit
   yield and soluble solids production were directly related to tree height
   regardless of the difference among rootstocks in juice quality. The same
   relationship existed among the trees in H2 in which the best rootstocks
   were C-32 and Morton citranges. Trees on Swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi
   Macf. x P. trifoliata) ranked no. 12 of 19 rootstocks and 9 of 13
   rootstocks in H1 and H2, respectively. Financial interpretation of the
   outcomes to include tree replacement resulting from blight losses did
   not substantially change the horticultural interpretations. Additional
   financial analyses demonstrated that the performance of trees on
   rootstocks with relatively low productivity/tree, like those on C-35
   citrange and Kinkoji, would equal those on more vigorous rootstocks when
   tree vigor was properly matched with spacing. Yield determined the
   economic outcomes and financial analysis aided the interpretation of
   rootstock horticultural effects but did not greatly alter the
   relationship among rootstock results. Highly significant correlations
   between annual and cumulative data indicated that relative rootstock
   performance among `Hamlin' orange trees in Florida could be reliably
   determined based on the first 4 cropping years.},

   chlorophyll content leaf water potential stomatal conductance and
   transpiration were significantly reduced by salinity in all graft
   combinations The inhibiting effect of salinity on growth varied
   according to the characteristics of the scion genotype and the level of
   salinity The results imply the predominance of the scion genotype in
   determining variation in the leaf level physiological characteristics of
   grafted vines because stomatal conductance and transpiration were higher
   in Sultana than in Muskule at the same leaf water potential and the
   level of salinity regardless of the rootstock genotype NaCl treatments
   did not affect leaf Cu concentration while inducing significant Na K Ca
   N P Mg Fe Mn and Zn elevations in the leaves of all scion/rootstock
   combinations While salinity caused an increase in N content and a
   decrease in K content in the roots of all graft combinations it had no
   influence on Ca P Cu and Zn concentrations In contrast to the Sultana
   grafted vines NaCl salinity led to a decrease in Mg Fe and Mn
   concentrations in the roots of Muskule grafted vines Nevertheless ion
   accumulation in leaves and roots of grafted vines under saline or non
   saline conditions was controlled predominantly by the genotype of the
   scion In response to salinity Sultana grafts accumulated higher amounts
   of ions in their leaves than in their roots However in Muskule higher
   ion concentrations were seen in the roots Therefore the increase in the
   transport of inorganic ions up to the leaves seems to be the major
   component of osmotic adjustment in salt stressed Sultana vines},

Abstract = {To gain insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of Grapevine fanleaf
   virus (GFLV) from the genus Nepovirus, family Secoviridae, the sequences
   of the complete coding region of RNA2, including genes 2A(HP), 2B(MP)
   and 2C(CP), and partial sequence from the RNA1-encoded gene 1E(Pol) of
   14 GFLV isolates from three naturally infected California vineyards were
   characterized. Phylogenetic analyses suggested two to three
   evolutionarily divergent lineages that did not reflect the vineyard
   origin of the isolates or an association with rootstock genotype or
   scion cultivar. Examination of the genetic variability of the California
   isolates alongside isolates worldwide, for which three RNA1 and 44 RNA2
   coding sequences are available, revealed similar patterns of molecular
   evolution for the different regions within the GFLV genome but distinct
   selection constraints with the strongest pressure exerted on genes
   2C(CP) and 28(MP), an intermediate level of pressure exerted on gene
   1E(Pol), and the weakest pressure exerted on gene 2A(HP). Some of the
   California isolates resulted from interspecies recombination events
   between GFLV and Arabis mosaic virus with crossover sites suspected in
   gene 1E(Pol) and identified in genes 2A(HP) and 2B(MP); and intraspecies
   recombination events inferred in the four target genes but most
   frequently observed within gene 2C(CP). This study suggested that
   purifying selection and recombination are important evolutionary
   mechanisms in the genetic diversification of GFLV. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {Differences in Defoliation of Fruit Genotypes by Adult Japanese Beetle

Abstract = {Since Japanese beetles ((Popillia japonica Newman, Coleoptera:
   Scarabaeidae) were first reported in Northwest Arkansas in 1997,
   population and geographic distribution have increased significantly
   accompanied by damage to horticultural crops and other plants. The adult
   beetle trapping period in Northwest Arkansas counties begins in June and
   continues until mid-August with the greatest capture from 7 to 30 July.
   This paper reports observations of adult Japanese beetle (JB) damage
   during the period of 2003 through 2005 in fruit crops grown in
   Fayetteville, AR. Adult beetle trap catches increased annually from 1997
   until 2004, decreased in 2005 and 2007 but rebounded in 2006 and 2008.
   The foliage of 262 apple, 27 apple rootstock, 17 crabapple, 21
   blueberry, 20 blackberry and 17 grape genotypes was evaluated for adult
   JB feeding damage by multiple evaluators during two growing seasons
   (2003 and 2004). The majority of apple, crabapple, blackberry,
   blueberry, and grape genotypes had moderate to severe foliar feeding
   damage, but, several apple, blackberry, blueberry, and grape genotypes
   had minimal damage. When apples of the same cultivar ('Gala') on
   different rootstocks were evaluated, scion foliage damage varied
   significantly with rootstock. The findings and observations of this
   study may be useful in future research on the molecular or biochemical
   basis for variation in feeding preference, for breeding new genotypes
   with low adult foliar feeding susceptibility, and as a basis for
   developing recommendations and management strategies for Japanese beetle
   in fruit plantings in the upper mid-south region.},

Abstract = {Growing of ZESPRI (R) Gold kiwifruit, Actinidia chinensis Planch.
   `Hort16A', under licence in Chile began in 2003. By 2006, 150 ha of
   `Hort16A' had been established, and vines started dying within 2 years.
   By the end of the 2008-2009 growing season, as many as 80\% of the
   plants in several orchards had died. The disease was characterized by a
   sudden wilting and dieback of plants any time during the growing season.
   In the spring, entire plants or parts of plants failed to break bud. In
   others, the buds broke, but juvenile leaf clusters then wilted and died.
   On severely affected plants, scion water shoots wilted and died. The
   disease was apparently most severe in sites that had been planted to
   Gold kiwifruit immediately after removal of apple, pear, citrus, or
   grape. Orchards planted following long-term maize, wheat, or grass
   culture were almost disease free. A fungus was consistently isolated
   from symptomatic vascular tissue. On the basis of morphological
   characteristics and by sequencing part of the Internal Transcribed
   Spacer (ITS) region with primers ITS1 and ITS4, the fungus was
   identified as Verticillium albo-atrum Reinke \& Berthier. To complete
   pathogenicity tests, 20 healthy, one-year-old A. deliciosa (A. Chev.) C.
   F. Liang \& A. R. Ferguson `Hayward', A. chinensis `Hort16A' and A.
   chinensis `Hort 16A'/A. deliciosa `Bruno' seedling rootstocks, were
   inoculated. Eight weeks after inoculation, typical wilting and dieback
   symptoms developed on 90\% of the plants. Control plants dipped in
   sterile distilled water remained healthy. Verticillium wilt has never
   been reported on kiwifruit (A. deliciosa) in Chile. V. albo-atrum has a
   rather narrow host range and is mainly reported as a pathogen on
   alfalfa, hop, soybean, tomato, and potato. This is the first report of
   V. albo-atrum causing wilt and dieback on Gold kiwifruit (A. chinensis)

Title = {Effect of KNO3 fertilization and rootstock on grapefruit response to
   reclaimed, salinized water},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2-4, SI},

Abstract = {During the last 50 years world irrigation has doubled while water
   withdrawal has tripled, leading to a global water crisis. As a result,
   growers around the world are forced to utilize effluent water for
   irrigation. In Israel the main source for such water is ``SHAFDAN{''},
   i.e., tertiary-treated waste water, which is characterized by high
   chloride content that might increase in the future. These days about
   33\% of Israeli citrus orchards are irrigated with this water, yet its
   potential effect on citrus orchards is not clear.
   Citrus is one of the major fruit crops of the world and is relatively
   salt-sensitive. Recently it was reported that continuous application of
   KNO3 might reduce chloride (Cl) uptake, and thus overcome the toxic
   effects of salinity. We examined the effect of KNO3 fertilization and
   rootstock on grapefruit's response to salinized SHAFDAN reclaimed water
   over four years. Trees were grafted on five different rootstocks and
   fertigated with two KNO3 regimes (118 vs. 148 mg l(-1) NO3), and exposed
   to five levels of salinized reclaimed water (from 221 to 765 mg l(-1)
   Cl). During the experiment, soil electrical conductivity (EC) ranged
   from 2 dS m(-1) (above the threshold for yield reduction) to 5 dS m(-1).
   Leaf Cl (with the exception of trees grafted on Troyer) usually kept
   below toxicity level, i.e., >0.4\%. Cumulative yield reduction due to
   salinity was 37.6, 21.3, 18.2, 17.2, and 12.6 kg per tree per dS m(-1)
   of soil paste extract, for trees grafted on 812, SO, Volk, Gau, and Troy
   rootstocks, respectively, reflecting their sensitivity to the osmotic
   component of salt stress. Enhanced application of KNO3 did not overcome
   the osmotic effect of salinity. These results indicate that while using
   reclaimed water, the osmotic component of salinity can be of higher
   significance than its toxic component, and more attention should be
   given in the future to the rootstock/scion combination's sensitivity to
   the osmotic component of salinity.},

   Investigation was carried out to study the susceptibility of grafted and
   own-rooted Thompson Seedless (Vitis vinifera L) vines to black leaf
   disorder Grapevines grafted on four different rootstocks viz. Dog Ridge
   (Vitis champini) Salt Creek (Vitis champini), B2-56 (Vitis berlandieri x

   content of various vine parts under saline irrigation in relation, to
   leaf blackening and necrosis symptoms were also studied. Thompson
   Seedless vines grafted on. Dog Ridge, Salt Creek and own rooted vines
   started developing leaf blackening and necrosis symptoms during the
   ripening stage. Vines exhibiting these symptoms contained significantly
   lower potassium (K+) and higher Na+ content in the leaf blades as
   compared to healthy vines. Vines grafted on Salt Creek showed most
   severe leaf blackening and necrosis symptoms and had the lowest K+
   content in blades and petioles. Amongst the rootstocks, vines raised on
   B2-56 had the lowest Na+ concentration in leaf blades whereas those on
   Dog Ridge and Salt Creek accumulated Na+ in leaf blades to a toxic
   level. Significantly higher K+ content was found in vines raised on
   B2-56 and 1613C rootstocks in all the vine parts compared to other
   stock-scion combinations. Vines grafted on B2-56 and 1613C could
   maintain higher K+: Na+ ratio and tolerated saline irrigation better
   than other stock-scion combinations. All the rootstocks reduced chloride
   concentration significantly in the vine parts (petioles, blade and

   on B2-56 rootstock had significantly higher phosphorus (P) concentration
   in petiole, blade and canes compared to vines grafted on Dog Ridge and

Abstract = {Post-budbreak freeze events on 7-8 Apr 2007 were followed by the
   development of aerial roots on wine-grapes later in the spring and
   continuing through the summer months. Rainfall and relative humidity
   were much higher than average during the months of May, June, and July
   following the freeze events. Aerial rooting of grapes has not been
   previously reported in Oklahoma; therefore, quantitative counts of
   aerial rooting were performed to determine if there was a relationship
   between aerial root formation and subsequent vine productivity. Aerial
   root production varied by scion cultivar and the effect of rootstock was
   unclear. Only Petit Verdot produced significantly more roots on a
   rootstock than not. It appears that the formation of aerial roots on
   grapevines in situ is a complex interaction of freeze injury and
   subsequent environmental conditions to produce roots. Aerial rooting was
   likely a sign of injury, but the number of aerial roots produced did not
   necessarily represent the degree of injury. Few or no roots may be
   produced when injury or damage is slight, more with moderate injury or
   damage, and few again when significant injury or damage is sustained.},

Abstract = {The term `transmissible small nuclear ribonucleic acids' (TsnRNAs)
   describes well-characterised viroid RNA species that do not induce any
   pronounced disease syndromes in specific citrus hosts, but rather act as
   regulatory genetic elements modifying tree performance. The canopy
   volume (CV) of 13-year-old navel orange trees (Citrus sinensis) on
   Poncirus trifoliata rootstock treated with TsnRNA-IIIb (syn. Citrus
   dwarfing viroid) was reduced by 45\% and 53.5\% in standard-density (6 m
   x 6.7 m) or high-density (3 m x 6.7 m) plantings, respectively. The
   total yield of eight consecutive harvests was not affected significantly
   by the TsnRNA-IIIb treatments or the two planting densities. However,
   the yield per land surface unit (Y/LSU) was almost doubled (increased by
   97.5\%) for the high-density plantings over the standard-density
   plantings of the untreated controls. The Y/LSU of the TsnRNA-IIIb
   treated navel orange trees in the standard-density planting was reduced
   by 32.7\%. The TsnRNA-IIIb treatment in both planting densities
   concentrated significantly more fruit production (approximately 60\%) in
   the economically advantageous middle canopy height zone (0.6-2.4 m) in
   comparison with the untreated controls (35\%). Fruit grade, size,
   appearance, organoleptic characteristics or time of maturation of the
   TsnRNA-IIIb dwarfed navel trees were not significantly different between
   the two planting densities and the controls. Fruit with higher
   commercial value was produced in the TsnRNA-IIIb dwarfed navel trees in
   the high-density planting by 3.9\% and 4.6\% over the TsnRNA-IIIb or
   controls in standard-density planting respectively. The increase in
   Y/LSU and fruit value for the TsnRNA-IIIb treated navel trees in the
   high-density plantings in combination with the reduced management cost
   of dwarfed trees could result in substantial higher profits for a
   commercial grove despite the higher establishment cost of high-density
   plantings.},

   species. As a result, management of viral diseases has largely relied
   upon prevention/exclusion or on the use of economically and/or
   environmentally consequential methods to manage vector populations.
   Resistance to dagger nematode vectors has been identified and
   successfully transferred to rootstock genotypes that are commercially
   available, but these resistant materials do not prevent virus
   translocation into the scion, although a significant delay in infection
   can allow for suitable production. In this review, we critically
   evaluate the literature regarding resistance against viruses and vectors
   in Vitis and Muscadinia species. We examine the challenges of breeding
   grapevines for virus resistance and the methodologies used to test for
   resistance. The availability of useful sources of resistance and
   tolerance toward both viruses and their vectors, or lack thereof, is
   evaluated and discussed in terms of disease management.},

Abstract = {The in vitro micrografting technique has been used in Cyprus and Greece
   since 2000 and 2007, respectively, to free from virus and other
   pathogens valuable citrus varieties and/or clones. Twenty-six among
   lemon, orange, mandarin, pummelo and bergamot accessions were selected
   from Cyprus citrus plantations and from the Poros Arboricultural Station
   and the Stamatakos nurseries in Greece. Scions derived from these trees
   were grafted onto healthy sour orange rootstocks in the greenhouse of
   the Agricultural Research Institute, Cyprus, for new apical meristems to
   be obtained for micrografting or micrografting was performed directly
   with meristem obtained from elite mother trees onto Carrizo, citrumelo
   or Troyer rootstocks. All mother plants were tested for viruses and
   viroids by biological indexing, by ELISA for Citrus tristeza
   closterovirus (CTV) and by RT-PCR for viroids. All mother trees were
   found free of CTV, Citrus variegation virus (CVV), concave gum and
   impietratura, but were infected by Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) and/or
   other viroids, including Citrus cachexia viroid (CCaVd) and Citrus bent
   leaf viroid (CBLVd), otherwise noted as CVdI. Some mother trees were
   infected by Citrus psorosis virus (CPsV). The standard procedure of
   shoot-tip grafting technique was used for elimination of viroids and
   CPsV in the selected citrus isolates. Micrografted plants were
   re-grafted on sour orange seedlings in vivo, or potted directly in soil
   and those successfully established were transferred to the glasshouse
   and tested 6-9 months later for the viruses and viroids present in the
   meristem donor mother plants. Citrus accessions produced by
   micrografting and found free of all viroids and CPsV were Cypriot lemon
   `Polyphori' and `Lapithou', `Arakapas' mandarin, `Jaffa' and `Siekeriko'
   orange, Bergamot, `Frappa' and `Coumantantas'. Tests for viroids and
   CPsV are being continued for all plants which were produced by shoot-tip
   grafting in vitro.},

Abstract = {The wine grape production in the tropical zone, and in particularly in
   the Brazilian semi-arid region, is dependent on irrigation practice due
   to insufficient rainfall and irregular distribution over three to four
   months in a year. Drip irrigation systems as well as vertical trellis
   system are predominant for wine grapes in this region. Some of the
   irrigation management guidance in practice in the field is based on
   previous experience and knowledge from other regions with some climate
   similarities, like USA (California) and Australia. As a relatively new
   crop in the Brazilian semi-arid region, first research results about
   irrigation scheduling or strategies in wine grapes are recent.
   Irrigation strategies as deficit irrigation, regulated deficit
   irrigation and partial rootzone drying have been evaluated. Therefore,
   research efforts in the Brazilian semi-arid region should be addressed
   to water consumption by scion/rootstock varieties, as well as
   ecophysiological behavior, berry and wine characteristics influenced by
   water management, according to local edaphic and climatic conditions.},

   grape root system},

Abstract = {The role of root systems in drought tolerance is a subject of very
   limited information compared with above-ground responses. Adjustments to
   the ability of roots to supply water relative to shoot transpiration
   demand is proposed as a major means for woody perennial plants to
   tolerate drought, and is often expressed as changes in the ratios of
   leaf to root area (A(L):A(R)). Seasonal root proliferation in a directed
   manner could increase the water supply function of roots independent of
   total root area (A(R)) and represents a mechanism whereby water supply
   to demand could be increased. To address this issue, seasonal root
   proliferation, stomatal conductance (g(s)) and whole root system
   hydraulic conductance (k(r)) were investigated for a drought-tolerant
   grape root system (Vitis berlandierixV. rupestris cv. 1103P) and a
   non-drought-tolerant root system (Vitis ripariaxV. rupestris cv.
   101-14Mgt), upon which had been grafted the same drought-sensitive clone
   of Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot. Leaf water potentials (epsilon(L)) for
   Merlot grafted onto the 1103P root system (-0.91 +/- 0.02 MPa) were
   +0.15 MPa higher than Merlot on 101-14Mgt (-1.06 +/- 0.03 MPa) during
   spring, but dropped by approximately -0.4 MPa from spring to autumn, and
   were significantly lower by -0.15 MPa (-1.43 +/- 0.02 MPa) than for
   Merlot on 101-14Mgt (at -1.28 +/- 0.02 MPa). Surprisingly, g(s) of
   Merlot on the drought-tolerant root system (1103P) was less
   down-regulated and canopies maintained evaporative fluxes ranging from
   35-20 mmol vine(-1) s(-1) during the diurnal peak from spring to autumn,
   respectively, three times greater than those measured for Merlot on the
   drought-sensitive rootstock 101-14Mgt. The drought-tolerant root system
   grew more roots at depth during the warm summer dry period, and the
   whole root system conductance (k(r)) increased from 0.004 to 0.009 kg
   MPa-1 s(-1) during that same time period. The changes in k(r) could not
   be explained by xylem anatomy or conductivity changes of individual root
   segments. Thus, the manner in which drought tolerance was conveyed to
   the drought-sensitive clone appeared to arise from deep root
   proliferation during the hottest and driest part of the season, rather
   than through changes in xylem structure, xylem density or stomatal
   regulation. This information can be useful to growers on a site-specific
   basis in selecting rootstocks for grape clonal material (scions) grafted
   to them.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of Phaeomoniella chlamydospora was investigated during
   vine propagation in an Italian nursery, and combined hot water (HWT) and
   cyproconazole treatments were carried out to limit the spread of the
   fungus in nursery vines. In the three-year period 2005-2007, cutting and
   graft samples (scion cv. Sangiovese, rootstock cv. 140Ru in 2005 and
   1103P in 2006-2007) were taken during propagation at several infection
   risk stages, and the occurrence of P. chlamydospora was assessed by
   nested PCR. In 2005 and 2006, cuttings from esca-symptomatic grapevines
   (scion cv. Sauvignon blanc, rootstock cv. 140Ru in 2005 and 1103P in
   2006) were treated at different stages of the propagation process. In
   2007, artificially infected 1103P cuttings were treated with HWT and
   cyproconazole after being inoculated with P. chlamydospora, and the
   fungus was detected by isolation on agar medium. The effect of HWT on
   the growth of 1103P, 779P, Sangiovese and Cabernet franc cuttings was
   also assessed. Despite extended wood discoloration, P. chlamydospora was
   scarce in nursery vines during the three-year period. The contamination
   of planting material may have resulted from already infected mother
   plants (0.0 to 6.7\% of infected cuttings) or may have started during
   the propagation, particularly after grafting (0.0 to 23.3\% of infected
   grafts). Canes from esca-diseased mother plants were always infected,
   but the incidence of infection of the cuttings varied widely (about 30\%
   in 2005, from 1.9 to 4.1\% in the other years). However, no final
   conclusions could be drawn about the stage or stages at which the
   nursery vines mainly became infected, because the infection frequencies
   detected in the propagation process were too low and irregular. As
   regards control of P. chlamydospora, HWT of cuttings performed before or
   after cold storage influenced plant growth, depending on both the
   cultivar and the growing conditions, but HWT was harmful to callused
   graftlings. Natural contamination of nursery material in 2005 and 2006
   was insufficient to allow the effectiveness of treatments to be
   assessed. In 2007, HWT and cyproconzole alone did not reduce the
   percentage of infection in artificially inoculated cuttings. Only
   cyproconazole immediately followed by HWT significantly reduced the
   number of infected cuttings, but this procedure did not eradicate the
   pathogen.},

   short review},
Journal = {VITIS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {In warm irrigated regions of Australia (such as Sunraysia), pH of grape
   juice often tends to be high (e.g. > 3.8). A high juice pH is
   undesirable for the production of quality wines as it results in wines
   of low quality for example, reduced colour stability and poor taste.
   Such a high juice pH is typically associated with a high concentration
   of K in the juice, depending on the scion, rootstock and location.
   Potassium is an essential nutrient and plant genotypes, including
   grapevines, differ in the accumulation of K in plant and/or plant parts.
   This difference in the accumulation of K by genotypes can be exploited
   to manipulate the concentration and content of K in plants, berries in
   particular for example, through selection and use of low K accumulating
   rootstocks to overcome the high pH affects. This paper briefly reviews
   the effects of juice pH and K on juice and wine quality, and the role
   and effect of rootstocks in the regulation of K in grapevine. This will
   provide a basic knowledge about the current research and key future
   research needed for the maintenance of acceptable quality of grape juice
   and wine through use of rootstocks.},

Abstract = {Rootstocks are a link between the soil and the canopy; they play an
   important role in vine adaptation to environmental factors. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate three rootstocks and two

   located at the city of Painel (28 degrees 01' 02{''} S and 50 degrees
   08'57{''}W, altitude 1200 m), in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil.
   The cultivar evaluated was the Cabernet Sauvingon grafted on Paulsen
   1103 (V. berlandieri x V. rupestris), Couderc 3309 and 101-14 Mgt (V.
   riparia x V. rupestris), the training systems evaluated were vertical
   shoot positioning trellis and Y trellis. The plants were five years old
   and the spacing was 3,0 x 1,5 m. The experiment was evaluated at the
   seasons 2007/08 and 2008/09. The experimental design was randomized
   blocks, with four blocks and 20 plants per plot. The variables analysed
   were leaf area, productivity, Ravaz index, pruning weight, weight and
   diameter of the berries, cluster weight, number of berries per cluster,
   soluble solids contents, total acidity, pH, anthocyanins contents, total
   polyphenols index and tannins. Plants grafted on 1103P presented the
   lowest productivity and biggest leaf area. The cultivar Couderc 3309 is
   the less vigorous rootstock, produces heavier berries and interferes
   positively on fruit set when increases the number of berries per cluster
   and berry weight. The rootstocks Paulsen 1103 and 101-14 Mgt, presents
   the best results for total anthocyanins contents.},

Journal = {JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL DES SCIENCES DE LA VIGNE ET DU VIN},
Year = {2011},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Aims: A trial of cv. Malbec grafted to six different rootstocks
   (Harmony. SO4, 1103 P. 140 Ru, 3309 C and Cereza) and own rooted cv.
   Malbec (ORMa) was carried out with the aim to study the influence of
   rootstock on the vegetative and reproductive performance of cv. Malbec.
   Another objective was to study the relationship between below ground
   (i.e., rootstock) and above ground (i.e., scion) growth under irrigated
   conditions, typical of Argentine viticulture.
   Methods and results: Four groups of rootstocks could be distinguished
   according to their vegetative and reproductive performance. The first
   group (Cereza and 3309 C, as ORMa) showed intermediate yield and high
   vegetative expression (V E). The second group (SO4 and 1103 P) was
   characterized by high yield and intermediate VE. The third group (140
   Ru) displayed intermediate yield and low YE. Finally, the fourth group
   (Harmony) showed low yield and low YE. 140 Ru showed the highest number
   of roots, while 1103 P. SO4 and Harmony showed the lowest number.
   Harmony showed a greater skin to berry ratio than 1103 P and a lower
   berry weight (1.56 g) than the rest of the treatments (1.7 g on
   average).
   Conclusion: Rootstocks influenced the biomass partitioning between
   leaves, grapes and roots: 140 Ru promoted root and reproductive
   development; Cereza. 3309 C and ORMa promoted vegetative development;
   SO4 and 1103 P promoted grape yield; and Harmony promoted root
   development.
   Significance and impact of the study: The absence of a general behavior
   pattern highlights the need to accurately assess the performance of each
   rootstock for each zone and each Vitis variety, in order to choose the
   most appropriate scion-rootstock combination.},

Abstract = {Two adjacent rootstock trials were conducted in the east coast Indian
   River region of Florida with `Marsh' grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.)
   scion. The objective was to find rootstocks to replace sour orange (C.
   aurantium L.) because of losses to citrus tristeza virus, and to replace
   Swingle citrumelo {[}C. paradisi x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.]
   because of its limited usefulness in certain poorly drained coastal
   sites. The trials were conducted in randomized complete blocks with 12
   single-tree replicates spaced 4.6 x 6.9 m. The soils were of the Wabasso
   and Riviera series. The first trial consisted largely of trees on
   citrange {[}C. sinensis (L.) Osb. x P. trifiliata] and citrumelo
   rootstocks, `Cipo' sweet orange (C. sinensis), and various hybrid
   rootstocks. The second trial involved mandarin rootstocks (C. reticulata
   Blanco) and sour orange and related rootstocks. Trees were grown for 7
   years and yield and juice quality data were collected for the last 4
   years of that period. Those rootstocks identified as the most promising,
   based on combinations of smaller tree size and high productivity and
   juice quality, were two Sunki mandarin x Swingle trifoliate orange (TF)
   hybrids (C-54, C-146), a Sunki mandarin x Flying Dragon TF hybrid, C-35
   citrange, and a Cleopatra mandarin x Rubidoux TF hybrid (x639). The
   trees on these five rootstocks cropped well leading to soluble solids
   (SS) values of 3000 to 4000 kg/ha when they were 7-years old. The trees
   on C-54 and C-146 were relatively large, somewhat taller than trees on
   sour orange, whereas those on C-35 and the Sunki x Flying Dragon hybrid
   were smaller and similar to sour orange in tree height. Fruit quality
   among the trees on C-35 and the Sunki x Flying Dragon hybrid had
   relatively high SS concentration (better than sour orange), and the
   other three rootstocks had relatively lower solids concentration (poorer
   than sour orange). The trees on C-35 and the Sunki x Flying Dragon
   hybrid would be good candidates for higher density orchards.},

Abstract = {In California, a novel closterovirus was detected in ``Redglobe{''}
   grapevine, associated with graft incompatibility and given a trivial
   name ``Grapevine rootstock stem lesion associated virus (GRSLaV).{''}
   The biological properties of the putative virus were ascertained when
   asymptomatic yet infected Redglobe scion buds were graft-inoculated onto
   test plants of Cabernet Sauvignon propagated on 18 different rootstocks.
   It proved lethal on test plants growing on rootstocks 1616C, 5BB, 5C,
   3309C, and 1103 P, whereas latent infections occurred on the remaining
   scion-rootstock combinations. In contrast, GLRaV-2 type (type strain)
   produced only typical leafroll symptoms. In a different experiment,
   GLRaV-2 type was successfully sap-transmitted to N. benthamiana, whereas
   sap transmission of GRSLaV was unsuccessful. Double-stranded RNA was
   extracted from infected Redglobe grapevines, cloned, sequenced, and
   determined a genome length of 16,527 nucleotides. Computer-assisted
   analysis of open-reading frames (ORFs) revealed a genome organization
   typical of monopartite viruses in the genus Closterovirus with nine ORFs
   (range 71-79\% identity) with GLRaV-2 type, the closest similar virus
   species within the family Closteroviridae. Also the 3'-UTR of GRSLaV
   consisted of 223 nucleotides with an extended oligo(A) tract similar to
   that of GLRaV-2 type, Beet yellow stunt virus, and Beet yellows virus.
   Recombinant GRSLaV coat protein was expressed in E. coli, purified, and
   immunized a rabbit to produce polyclonal antiserum. Serological data
   matched the molecular data, whereby exposed plant tissue extracts of
   grapevines infected by both viruses (GRSLaV and GLRaV-2) reacted
   positively with homologous and heterologous viral antisera but not with
   healthy grapevine extracts in ELISA and Western blot tests. Based on the
   comparative sequence data and shared antigens, GRSLaV is now considered
   a strain of GLRaV-2 and redesignated as Grapevine leafroll associated
   virus-2 Redglobe (GLRaV-2RG). Primers specific for GLRaV-2RG were
   developed, which did not amplify GLRaV-2 type strain. When both sets of
   specific primers were used in assays of different grapevine collections,
   the incidence of the respective viruses varied considerably, e.g., 1.7
   and 13.5\%, respectively, for GLRaV-2RG and GLRaV-2 type.},

   vegetatively propagated fruit crops like citrus, induced mutation for
   seedlessness in Kinnow with gamma irradiation of dormant bud which was
   attempted at the Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology (NIAB),
   Faisalabad. Dormant bud irradiation-cum-grafting technique was employed,
   using the Citrus jambhiri rootstock for propagation of the scion. A
   sparse seeded (5 +/- 3 seeds/fruit) mutant was evolved from an exposure
   dose of 20 Gy. The mutant was put to the conventional propagation up to
   mV5, for confirmation of the continuity of the mutation. The sparse
   seeded mutation was found to be a solid and stable one. The quality
   parameters in fruit and juice of the mutant were comparable with its
   parent.},

Abstract = {The application of protoplast fusion technology in citrus improvement
   has resulted in the regeneration of somatic hybrid plants from more than
   500 parental combinations, and many of these have been evaluated in
   field trials. In rare cases, a new somatic hybrid may have direct
   utility as an improved scion or rootstock cultivar; however, the most
   important application of somatic hybridization is the building of novel
   germplasm as a source of elite breeding parents for various types of
   conventional crosses. Somatic hybridization is beginning to have a major
   impact on our scion improvement program by the generation of superior
   allotetraploid breeding parents for use in interploid crosses to
   generate seedless triploids. Seedlessness is a primary breeding
   objective for new fresh fruit citrus cultivars, and hundreds of triploid
   hybrids have been produced using somatic hybrids as the tetraploid
   parent. Triploid progeny from such crosses are beginning to fruit, and
   superior seedless selections are being made for mandarin,
   pummelo/grapefruit, and acid fruit (lemon/lime) improvement; examples of
   each will be provided. Characterization and selection of parents for
   interploid crosses is also impacting other important traits including
   thorniness, disease resistance and cold-hardiness. Successful somatic
   hybridization in citrus rootstock improvement has allowed for the
   creation of a rootstock breeding program at the tetraploid level that
   achieves maximum genetic diversity in zygotic progeny and has great
   potential for tree size control via polyploidy. Tree size control has
   gained importance as a means of reducing harvesting costs, maximizing
   the efficiency of modern cold protection methodology, and facilitating
   the adaptation of new fruit production systems that feature high density
   plantings and open hydroponics. Rootstock breeding at the tetraploid
   level facilitates the packaging of the many required traits for an
   improved rootstock into individual hybrids, including wide adaptation to
   diverse soil and environmental conditions, ability to consistently
   produce high yields of quality fruit, and especially disease and insect
   resistance. Recent progress and successful examples of these
   applications will be discussed. Continued feedback from field trials of
   both scion and rootstock somatic hybrids and their progeny is
   facilitating the identification of superior breeding parents and cross
   combinations, thereby accelerating the development of improved citrus
   cultivars.},

Abstract = {Salinity affects grapevine growth and production when salt concentration
   in the plant organs increases to levels that interfere with
   physiological activities. Petiole analysis is a more sensitive indicator
   of sodium and chloride than blade or whole-leaf analysis. Salinity is
   caused by high salt concentrations in the root zone that may be due to,
   among others, saline irrigation water. Other factors that are mostly
   associated with warm climates are an elevated saline water table or
   environmental conditions inducing high evaporation. Drip is the most
   appropriate irrigation method for saline conditions due to its positive
   interaction with soil aeration and mineral distribution in the
   onion-shaped irrigated root zone. American hybrid rootstocks tested in
   the Negev desert of Israel, among them Salt Creek and 140 Ruggeri,
   showed higher resistance to salinity due to their ability to limit the
   salt's movement into the scion of several Vinifera cultivars and thereby
   maintain lower Na and Cl concentrations in the leaves and fruits.
   Following several successive drought years, water sources in Israel, in
   both water reservoirs and underground aquifers, have been diminished and
   the salinity level has increased. Conditions of negative water balance
   in which precipitation decreases and evaporative demand increases, and
   consumption by increasing population and agricultural production, lead
   to the unavoidable solution - water desalination. Recent developments in
   membrane technology have enabled the use of reverse osmosis at a cost
   that is only slightly higher than current practices. This ongoing
   project is aimed at desalinating sea water for human consumption, and
   purifying and desalinating effluents for agricultural and industrial
   use. This plan will solve present and future supply scarcity, and
   maintain high water quality while preserving and improving the
   environment and recovering the above and underground aquifers.},

Abstract = {The clone refers to a vine cultivar that is selected for specific
   qualities, such as resistance to certain diseases or desired cluster
   size, taste or smell. Rootstocks are a link between the soil and the
   scion, they play an important role in vine adaptation to environmental
   factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate five `Cabernet
   Sauvignon' clones grafted on two rootstocks and their influence on fruit
   quality. The experiment was conducted in Villa Francioni vineyards
   located at the city of Sao Joaquim (28 degrees 17'S; 49 degrees 56'W,
   altitude 1350 m), in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. The experimental
   design was randomized blocks, with three blocks and 20 plants per plot.
   The plants of `Cabernet Sauvignon' were grafted on 1103 P and 3309 C and
   conducted in vertical shoot positioning trellis. The clonal selections
   evaluated were 169, 337, 170, 341, 339 and R5. The scion-rootstock
   combinations were 169 on 1103 P, 169 on 3309 C, 337 on 1103 P, 170 on
   3309 C, 339 on 3309 C, 341 on 1103 P and R5 on 1103 P. The variables
   analysed were cluster and 50 berries weight, number of berries per
   cluster, berry diameter, cluster compactness, anthocyanins contents (mg
   L-1), total polyphenols, tannins, pH, total soluble solids, acidity (meq
   L-1) and color intensity. Data were submitted to analysis of variance
   and Tukey's test (5\% probability). To the variables total soluble
   solids and acidity, the clone 169 on 1103 P presented the best results,
   while to pH the clone 170 on 3309 C was better. The maximum
   concentration of anthocyanins was observed in 339 grafted on 3309 C. The
   highest levels of total polyphenols, tannins and color intensity were

   Viticultural data were collected for three years. Vitis vinifera L.
   `Cabernet Sauvignon' and `Kekfrankos' scion wood was bench-grafted on
   `Teleki 5C', `Teleki Kober 5BB', `Teleki Fuhr SO4', `Fercal' and
   `Georgikon 28' rootstocks. Grafted vines were planted in Cserszegtomaj,
   Hungary (46 degrees 49'45 `' N; 17 degrees 15'16 `' E). Vineyard
   establishment, trellis systems, and cultural practices were standardized
   among the blocks and years. The soil conditions were the same, but the
   three years were different in heat summation and precipitation. The two
   cultivars had different yield production, sugar collection and total
   acid content independent of the rootstock effect. The greatest benefits
   of using rootstocks were seen in 2007, where extreme dry weather
   conditions hit the vineyards and the yields from `Cabernet sauvignon'
   increased 30\% on `SO4' and 19\% on `Georgikon 28', yields from
   `Kekfrankos' increased 11\% on `SO4' and `Fercal'. In addition to yield
   effects, grafting combinations with `Teleki 5C' on `Cabernet sauvignon'
   and `Georgikon 28' on `Kekfrankos' had greater sugar accumulation. Both
   scion cultivars had the highest phenolic compound concentrations in both
   years (anthocyanin, proanthocyanin and catechin) grafted on `Teleki

Abstract = {Citrus is the most extensively produced tree fruit crop in the world.
   There are two clearly differentiated markets: the fresh fruit and the
   processed juice market. Citrus species are essentially diploids (2n = 2x
   = 18) and were domesticated in Southeast Asia several thousand years ago
   and then spread throughout the world. Most of the cultivated citrus
   species are part of the Citrus genus containing, depending on the
   taxonomist, between 16 and 156 species. The relative complexity of these
   classifications results from the conjunction of a broad morphological
   diversity, total sexual interspecific compatibility within the genus and
   apomixis. There are four basic taxa on the basis of morphological
   descriptors and molecular data (C. maxima (Burm.) Merr., the pummelos;
   C. medica L., the citrons, C. reticulata Blanco, the andarins, and C.
   micrantha Wester). The other cultivated species (C. aurantium L., the
   sour orange; C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck, the sweet orange; C. paradisi
   Macf, the grapefruit; C. limon (L.) Burm. f., the lemon, and C.
   aurantifolia (Christm.) Swingle, the lime) appeared by recombination
   among the basic taxa. Most of the citrus scion cultivars result from the
   selection of spontaneous bud mutations identified in production
   orchards. Today several projects of ploidy manipulation are developed in
   different countries to select seedless triploid mandarins. Fruit quality
   (size, color, easy-peeling), seedlessness, and the extension of the
   harvest season are the main selection objectives for fresh market
   cultivars. The majority of the rootstocks used for propagation are
   original species or ancient natural hybrids. However, intergeneric
   hybrids (Citrus x Poncirus) such as citranges, citrumelos, and
   citrandarins have an increasing importance. The first rootstock breeding
   objective is adaptation to soil conditions and soil pathogens. The most
   widespread needs would be tolerance to CTV. Biotechnology is strongly
   integrated into breeding and propagation schemes. Shoot tip grafting is
   widely used for sanitation of the mother plants in certification
   propagation schemes. Somatic hybridization is an effective tool used for
   scion and rootstock breeding. Functional genomics studies ESTs,
   microarray platforms, and a full genonne sequence are available.
   Efficient and reliable transformation systems for several economically
   important citrus species exist.},

Abstract = {A rootstock field trial was conducted in the Yakima Valley, southeastern
   Washington, with three Vitis vinifera cultivars (Merlot, Syrah,
   Chardonnay). Vines were grown on their own roots or field-grafted to the
   rootstocks 5C, 99R, 140Ru, 1103P, 3309C, and an unnamed rootstock from
   Cornell University (here termed 101CU) that is a likely sibling or
   seedling of 101-14 Mgt. Repeated scion dieback due to cold injury to 99R
   led us to abandon this rootstock. Vine phenology, vigor, water status,
   yield formation, and fruit ripening and composition were evaluated
   during three years beginning in the vineyard's ninth year. Own-rooted
   Merlot and Chardonnay grew more shoots than grafted vines, and 140Ru and
   1103P tended to reduce pruning weights. However, 3309C was the rootstock
   associated with the highest pruning weights in Syrah and the lowest in
   Chardonnay. Rootstocks usually did not impact vine phenology, fruit set,
   and plant water status, although there was a trend for stem water
   potential to be highest with 3309C and lowest with 5C. The rootstock
   effect on yield formation depended on the scion cultivar, and variations
   in different yield components often cancelled out each other, but 3309C
   (Merlot and Syrah), 5C (Merlot and Chardonnay), and own roots
   (Chardonnay) were often associated with high yields. Nevertheless, the
   rootstocks had only minor effects on fruit ripening and did not
   consistently alter soluble solids, TA, K+, or anthocyanin pigments, but
   the pH was higher in fruit from own-rooted vines compared with grafted
   Merlot and Chardonnay. Overall, scion effects and differences due to
   yearly climate variation far outweighed any differences due to
   rootstock.},

   variables measured were ethanol, TA, pH, potassium, tannins, total iron

   caused few significant differences in fruit and wine composition and
   instead the dominant factors were scion and, to a lesser extent,
   vintage. All fruit and wine variables measured with the exception of TSS
   varied significantly with scion. Only TSS and berry size were
   consistently affected by vintage. Rootstock had no effect on grape
   anthocyanins and tannins. However, significant but small and variable
   effects were observed for wine anthocyanins and tannins. Wines from
   own-rooted vines tended to have somewhat higher pH, potassium, and total
   tannin than did wines from grafted vines. The relationships between
   fruit and wine for anthocyanins and tannins were not straightforward and

Abstract = {Grapes are grown worldwide, on about 7.9 million ha, and are used to
   produce wine, raisins, juice, jam, concentrate, and seed oils, as well
   as fresh fruit. Grapes (Vitis sp.) are members of the Vitaceae. Vitis
   includes two subgenera, Euvitis (38 chromosomes) and Muscadinia (40
   chromosomes), with about 60 species in total. The primary centers of
   species diversity are North America and East Asia. Scion cultivars are
   derived chiefly from the European grape, Vitis vinifera, which was
   domesticated ca. 6,000-10,000 years ago in the region between the Black
   and Caspian Seas. Grapes spread east into Asia and west into the
   Mediterranean region. Rootstocks were developed from North American
   species, including V. riparia, V. rupestris, and V. berlandieri. Scion
   breeding programs focus on the development of cultivars adapted to
   biotic and abiotic stress, with high fruit quality, and time of ripening
   during desirable periods of market demand. Fungal disease resistance is
   a primary goal of many programs, while cold hardy cultivars help extend
   the limits of grape cultivation. Rootstock breeding focuses on providing
   protection against phylloxera and nematodes as well as adaptation to
   high pH, low pH, and/or water-stressed conditions. Rootstocks should
   propagate easily by grafting and cuttings. New cultivars are more
   rapidly adapted in the raisin and table grape sectors than in the wine
   industry, although there are several notable examples of successful wine
   grape cultivars developed by breeding. The availability of two published
   genomic DNA sequences has stimulated numerous projects to further
   understand the function of the ca. 30,000 grapevine genes.
   Marker-assisted selection, primarily for disease resistance and
   seedlessness, is being applied in many breeding programs. Projects that
   focus on breeding seedless cultivars commonly use embryo rescue
   techniques, enabling the crossing of two seedless parents, to increase
   the percentage of seedlings that are seedless. Genetic transformation is
   a routine procedure and is being used for both functional analysis of
   gene action as well as directly for cultivar improvement (both scions
   and rootstocks), although transgenic grape cultivars currently are not
   in commercial production.},

Abstract = {Citrus canker (Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri) has been introduced into
   Florida numerous times. The most recent eradication efforts were
   suspended in 2006 after a series of hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 spread
   the disease statewide. In central Florida, seedlings of 10 rootstocks
   and trees of 8 scion cultivars were evaluated for canker after being
   established for 9 to 18 months in a trial of nonbearing trees planted
   adjacent to young grapefruit trees that were highly infected with citrus
   canker. All rootstocks and scions were susceptible to foliar citrus
   canker to varying degrees. Rootstocks were ranked as predicted by the
   known susceptibility of the parental genotypes to citrus canker. Swingle
   citrumelo (trifoliate hybrid with grapefruit) was the most susceptible,
   followed by Carrizo and Kuharske citrange (trifoliate hybrid with sweet
   orange), and sour orange (pummelo parentage). Seedlings of X639, US812,
   and US897 (trifoliate hybrids of Cleopatra mandarin or Sunki) were
   moderately susceptible. Volkamer lemon, Cleopatra mandarin, and Kinkoji
   leaves were the least susceptible rootstocks. Within the scion
   varieties, `Minneola' tangelo, `Murcott' tangor, `Valencia', `Fallglo'

Title = {WOOD NECROSIS IN ESCA-AFFECTED VINES: TYPES, RELATIONSHIPS AND POSSIBLE

Abstract = {Aims: Esca disease of grapevine is characterised by foliar symptoms
   associated with the development of various internal wood necroses. The
   aims of the present study are to determine the type and the quantity of
   necroses in the various woody compartments of vines, the relationships
   between them and the links between necroses and severity of foliar
   symptoms.
   Methods and results: Symptomatic and asymptomatic vines cv
   Cabernet-Sauvignon were cross-sectioned to quantify the different types
   of internal necrosis in the scions (cordons, heads, and trunks) and
   rootstocks. Five necrosis ``variables{''} were accounted for: central
   necrosis, sectorial necrosis, mixed necrosis, white rot, altered
   perimeter and in addition to the variable healing cone. In the scion,
   for all types of necrosis variables, a significant correlation between
   compartments was found. Vines with acute foliar form of esca had very
   advanced peripheral tissue degradations in the xylem and cambial zones.
   Chronic foliar expression of esca was associated with quantity of
   internal necroses higher than those obtained for asymptomatic vines. A
   logistic model indicated that white rot in the cordons was the best
   predictor for the chronic form of esca.
   Conclusion: Necroses formed a continuum within the plant. The scion is
   like a single unit with a volume of necroses useful to determine the
   health status of vines.
   Significance and impact or the study: A quantitative analysis of vine
   internal necroses would open up new possibilities for esca-epidemic
   approaches.},

Abstract = {In Northern California, surveys of several vineyards planted to Vitis
   vinifera cv. Pinot noir (PN) clones 02A, 667, 777, and UCD 04 grafted
   onto the rootstock V berlandieri x V rupestris 110 Richter (110R)
   revealed 2 to 45\% of vines showing solid red leaf canopies and two
   distinct disease stages, i.e., full canopied plants with normal grape
   clusters (designated as acute) or stunted shoots and straggly bunches
   (designated as chronic). In addition, the scion-rootstock junction of
   symptomatic grapevines had developed a necrotic union; hence, the name
   `grapevine necrotic union' (GNU). Also, two white fruited cultivars,
   Chardonnay (clone 04, vineyard in Yolo county) and Pinot gris (clone
   152, vineyard in Monterey county), exhibited GNU-associated symptoms,
   with an exception of pale yellowed leaves. A detailed survey, from 2004
   to 2009, was made in a sub-block containing 664 grapevines (8 rows x
   80-85 grapevines) in a PN 02A vineyard (planted in 1997) located in
   Sonoma county. The initial incidence of GNU was 2.1\% in 2004 and rose
   to 21.9\% by 2009 suggesting secondary spread. Molecular assays (RT-PCR
   and PCR) for grapevine viruses, phytoplasmas, and Xylella fastidiosa,
   failed to detect a putative causal agent. Likewise, bud-chip
   inoculations of test plants of Cabernet sauvignon scions on different
   rootstocks, including 110R, were inconclusive. However, several
   bench-grafts of collections of PN 02A, PN 91 and Chardonnay 04 onto 110R
   produced plants that developed GNU symptoms in a research plot. Based on
   the results obtained so far, GNU is being regarded as an emerging
   disease of unknown etiology in California vineyards.},

Abstract = {The stomatal control of transpiration is one of the major strategies by
   which plants cope with water stress. Here, we investigated the genetic
   architecture of the rootstock control of scion transpiration-related
   traits over a period of 3 yr.
   The rootstocks studied were full sibs from a controlled interspecific
   cross (Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon x Vitis riparia cv. Gloire
   de Montpellier), onto which we grafted a single scion genotype. After 10
   d without stress, the water supply was progressively limited over a
   period of 10 d, and a stable water deficit was then applied for 15 d.
   Transpiration rate was estimated daily and a mathematical curve was
   fitted to its response to water deficit intensity. We also determined
   delta C-13 values in leaves, transpiration efficiency and water
   extraction capacity. These traits were then analysed in a
   multienvironment (year and water status) quantitative trait locus (QTL)
   analysis.
   Quantitative trait loci, independent of year and water status, were
   detected for each trait. One genomic region was specifically implicated
   in the acclimation of scion transpiration induced by the rootstock. The
   QTLs identified colocalized with genes involved in water deficit
   responses, such as those relating to ABA and hydraulic regulation.
   Scion transpiration rate and its acclimation to water deficit are thus
   controlled genetically by the rootstock, through different genetic
   architectures.},

Abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is the most devastating disease of citrus. The
   global citrus industry is in urgent need of effective chemical
   treatments for HLB control because of its rapid spreading worldwide. Due
   to the fastidious nature of the pathogens, and the poor permissibility
   of citrus leaf surfaces, effective screening of chemicals for the HLB
   control can be challenging. In this study, we developed a graft-based
   chemotherapy method to rapidly screen potential HLB-controlling chemical
   compounds. In addition, we improved transmission efficiency by using the
   best HLB-affected scion rootstock combination, and demonstrated the HLB
   bacterial titer was the critical factor in transmission. The
   HLB-affected lemon scions had a high titer of HLB bacterium, survival
   rate (83.3\%), and pathogen transmission rate (59.9\%). Trifoliate, a
   widely used commercial rootstock, had the highest survival rate
   (>70.0\%) compared with grapefruit (52.6\%) and sour orange (50.4\%).
   Using this method, we confirmed a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin
   was the most effective compounds in eliminating the HLB bacterium from
   the HLB-affected scions, and in successfully rescuing severely
   HLB-affected citrus germ-plasms. These findings are useful not only for
   chemical treatments but also for graft-based transmission studies in HLB
   and other Liberibacter diseases.},

   years. In three seasons, whole-tree crops were sized in the field. Using
   the fruit size distribution data, crop value or income/tree was
   estimated. Tree height after 10 years ranged from 1.7 to 4.1 in and

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {20-26},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The influence of irrigation amount and frequency of application on
   growth and yield of Sultana grapevines was studied in a field trial
   carried out over four years in the Murray Valley irrigation area of
   Australia. Treatments included low (280 mm of irrigation and rainfall),
   medium (780 mm) and high (1300 mm) application amounts, each with
   frequencies of 1,2 and 4-weekly. Despite artificial drainage, there was
   a watertable of variable depth: its effect was evaluated by grouping
   plots into those with shallow (<2.2 m depth) or deep (>2.2 m depth)
   watertables. Treatments were applied to grapevines with Sultana scions
   grafted to Ramsey rootstocks and own-rooted Sultana vines. Yields from
   vines grafted to Ramsey were largely unchanged by irrigation treatments
   even where shallow watertables resulted in high soil salinities (ECe >
   3.0 dS m(-1)), probably because of the capacity of Ramsey rootstock to
   exclude chloride ions. For vines on their own roots, there were
   interactions between irrigation frequency and watertable depth for soil
   salinity and yield, with the fortnightly frequency offering the best
   compromise where there was a shallow watertable. The response to
   irrigation amount also depended on watertable depth; the low amount
   reduced yield relative to that in the medium and high amounts in areas
   where the watertable was deep but not in areas where it was shallow.
   Yield in the medium and high amounts tended to be lower in areas where
   the water table was shallow compared with areas where it was deep. The
   results suggest that where shallow watertables are present irrigation
   management should be modified for both own-rooted and Ramsey grafted
   Sultanas to apply no more than moderate amounts of irrigation and
   preferably at not less than fortnightly intervals. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {Successful grafting in plants requires the development of a functional
   vascular system between the scion and the rootstock. Understanding the
   spatial organization of the graft interface is important to the
   evaluation of new rootstock genotypes and to the development of new
   grafting technologies. Until now the graft interface has only been
   studied using 2D classical histology and low resolution 3D magnetic
   resonance imaging. Here we investigate the ability of X-ray tomography
   to examine the graft interface of Vitis vinifera in high resolution and
   in 3D.
   Data were collected using a Skyscan 1076, scanning parameters, such as.
   X-ray energy, filter selection, pixel size and rotation angles, were
   optimized to study the particularities of the graft interface. The X-ray
   tomography technique was then used to evaluate graft quality. Two young
   vines were compared; one graft was classified as of `good' quality,
   whereas the other was classified as of `bad' quality. We were able to
   distinguish the ``omega cut{''}, the pith, the phloem and the xylem
   vessels in the images. The analysis shows several differences between
   the two vines. In the good graft, tissues appear well-connected in the
   wood and phloem, and had a regular structure; the wood appears
   homogenous with a lot of vessels that form a compact mass. By contrast,
   in the bad graft, the structures appear disorganized and not completely
   connected.
   Numerous new vessels, continuous between the scion and the rootstock,
   are visible in the ``good graft{''} whereas only few ones are visible in
   the ``bad one{''}. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that 3D
   imaging of the graft interface and the vascular connections across it
   have been reported, opening new avenues for graft quality assessment in

   disease. Plant Dis. 96:1488-1494.
   Management of almond leaf scorch disease requires knowledge of all
   possible infection pathways. The disease is caused by the xylem-limited
   bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which is transmitted by several species of
   sharpshooters. The objectives of this research were to elucidate the
   fate of bacteria in planta after inoculations in almond nursery plants
   and to determine patterns of insect vector population dynamics and
   temporal distribution of X. fastidiosa infected plants relative to host
   plant assemblages in habitats surrounding commercial nurseries. In an
   experimental nursery, disease incidence was markedly affected by
   rootstock type. Prior to bud grafting, `Nemaguard' rootstock seedlings
   were not susceptible to bacterial infection. After bud grafting with a
   susceptible scion ('Sonora'), scions were susceptible to infection
   regardless of rootstock genotype. Surveys near commercial nurseries
   revealed that only habitats with permanent grass cover sustained vector
   populations throughout the season. A total of 87 plant samples tested
   positive for X. fastidiosa (6.3\%) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA), with a higher number of X. fastidiosa infected plants
   found in weedy alfalfa fields than in other habitat types. Among plant
   species infected by X. fastidiosa, 33\% were winter annuals, 45\% were
   biennials or perennials, and 22\% were summer annuals. Collectively,
   these findings identified a potential pathway for X. fastidiosa
   infection of almonds in nursery situations.},

Abstract = {Genetically engineered (GE) rootstocks may offer some advantages for
   biotechnology applications especially in woody perennial crops such as
   grape or walnut. Transgrafting combines horticultural grafting practices
   with modern GE methods for crop improvement. Here, a non-GE conventional
   scion (upper stem portion) is grafted onto a transgenic GE rootstock.
   Thus, the scion does not contain the genetic modification present in the
   rootstock genome. We examined transgene presence in walnut and tomato GE
   rootstocks and non-GE fruit-bearing scions. Mobilization of transgene
   DNA, protein, and mRNA across the graft was not detected. Though
   transgenic siRNA mobilization was not observed in grafted tomatoes or
   walnut scions, transgenic siRNA signal was detected in walnut kernels.
   Prospective benefits from transgrafted plants include minimized risk of
   GE pollen flow (Lev-Yadun and Sederoff, 2001), possible use of more than
   one scion per approved GE rootstock which could help curb the estimated
   US\$ 136 million (CropLife International, 2011) cost to bring a GE crop
   to international markets, as well as potential for improved consumer and
   market acceptance since the consumable product is not itself GE. Thus,
   transgrafting provides an alternative option for agricultural industries

Abstract = {Vitis vinifera scions are commonly grafted onto rootstocks of other
   grape species to influence scion vigour and provide resistance to
   soil-borne pests and abiotic stress; however, the mechanisms by which
   rootstocks affect scion physiology remain unknown. This study
   characterized the hydraulic physiology of Vitis rootstocks that vary in
   vigour classification by investigating aquaporin (VvPIP) gene
   expression, fine-root hydraulic conductivity (Lp(r)), \% aquaporin
   contribution to Lp(r), scion transpiration, and the size of root
   systems. Expression of several VvPIP genes was consistently greater in
   higher-vigour rootstocks under favourable growing conditions in a
   variety of media and in root tips compared to mature fine roots. Similar
   to VvPIP expression patterns, fine-root Lp(r) and \% aquaporin
   contribution to Lp(r) determined under both osmotic (Lp(r)(Osm)) and
   hydrostatic (Lp(r)(Hyd)) pressure gradients were consistently greater in
   high-vigour rootstocks. Interestingly, the \% aquaporin contribution was
   nearly identical for Lp(r)(Osm) and Lp(r)(Hyd) even though a hydrostatic
   gradient would induce a predominant flow across the apoplastic pathway.
   In common scion greenhouse experiments, leaf area-specific transpiration
   (E) and total leaf area increased with rootstock vigour and were
   positively correlated with fine-root Lp(r). These results suggest that
   increased canopy water demands for scion grafted onto high-vigour
   rootstocks are matched by adjustments in root-system hydraulic
   conductivity through the combination of fine-root Lp(r) and increased
   root surface area.},

Title = {Responses of young `Pink lady' apple to alternate deficit irrigation

Abstract = {We studied photosynthetic capacity, growth, sap flow, and water-use
   efficiency in young trees of `Pink Lady' apple (Malus domestica) that
   were exposed to 60 d of moisture stress. Three irrigation schemes were
   tested in the greenhouse: well-watered control; drought; or alternate
   deficit irrigation (ADI). Compared with the drought-stressed plants,
   those treated via ADI showed better height growth, larger scion
   diameters, and greater total leaf area, as well as significantly
   increased gains in dry biomass and rootstock diameters. However, their
   performance was still significantly lower than that demonstrated by
   continuously well-watered plants. Sap flow was greater under ADI than
   under drought, but less than under control conditions. The average rate
   of net photosynthesis, total amount of irrigation water applied, and dry
   biomass gain had highly significant and positive linear correlations
   with long-term water-use efficiency (WUEL). The same was true between
   average stomatal conductance and WUEL. By contrast, instantaneous
   water-use efficiency (WUEI) was very significantly and negatively
   correlated with WUEL. In addition, values for WUEL were much higher from
   well-watered plants when compared with either drought-stressed trees or
   those treated per ADI. Therefore, our results indicate that, although
   `Pink Lady' apple normally has high WUE, it still consumes a large
   amount of water. Therefore, the practice of ADI following a period of
   long-term drought could be used to improve growth and WUEL by this
   cultivar.},

Title = {Unveiling inoculum sources of black foot pathogens in a commercial
   grapevine nursery},
Journal = {PHYTOPATHOLOGIA MEDITERRANEA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {298-312},
Abstract = {Black foot of grapevine is an important disease caused primarily by
   Ilyonectria spp. and ``Cylindrocarpon{''} pauciseptatum. These pathogens
   affect grapevine nurseries and young vineyards, causing the decline and
   death of plants. In the nursery, the primary infections of the grafted
   cuttings are mainly attributed to soil-borne inoculum, which could
   infect the roots and the basal end of rootstocks during the rooting
   stage. The aim of this research was to detect other possible sources of
   inoculum throughout the different nursery stages by classical and
   molecular techniques (nested-PCR and multiplex nested-PCR). Results
   revealed the presence of the I. liriodendri and/or I. macrodidyma
   complex in grapevine rootstock and scion cuttings, cutting tools, water
   from hydration tanks, well water, callusing medium, one indoor air
   sample and soils collected from mother fields and nurseries.
   ``Cylindrocarpon{''} pauciseptatum was only detected in the callusing
   medium, nursery soils, rooted-graftlings and on the root pruning
   machine. Forty four isolates obtained from soils (mother fields and
   nurseries) and rooted graftlings (six grapevine cultivar/rootstock
   combinations) were sequenced for part of histone H3 gene to resolve the
   species. While I. liriodendri, I. macrodidyma and I. torresensis were
   identified from soil samples, from rooted graftlings it was also
   possible to detect I. liriodendri, I. macrodidyma, I. novozelandica, I.
   torresensis, Ilyonectria sp. 2, ``C.{''} pauciseptatum and four
   Ilyonectria isolates which are close to I. cyclaminicola. The results
   demonstrated that, in addition to nursery soils, mother field soils,
   rootstock and scion cuttings, water from wells and hydration tanks,
   callusing media, cutting tools and indoor air should be considered as
   potential sources of inoculum for black foot pathogens.},

Abstract = {Selection of resistant rootstocks to overcome recent climate-change
   events is a crucial factor for developing sustainable agricultural
   practices and for assuring optimal quality of grapes. Our study examined
   responses of four new rootstocks selected for resistance to water and
   salt stresses, iron chlorosis, vigor reduction, and enhanced potassium
   (K) and magnesium (Mg) uptake efficiency. The new rootstocks are the
   result of crossing various species of Vitis (riparia, cordifolia,
   rupestris and berlandieri) alone or in combination. The four new
   genotypes were compared with six conventional rootstocks grown at five
   locations in Italy, using the same `Cabernet Sauvignon' scion and
   similar management practices. This paper reports the 2011 data for leaf
   SPAD and NDVI values, and K, Mg, calcium (Ca), iron (Fe) and boron (B)
   concentrations both in leaves and in petioles sampled at veraison.},

Abstract = {The concentration of potassium (K) and pH in juice of grapevines is
   influenced by rootstocks (Vitis). However, the performance of rootstocks
   with respect to berry quality parameters and inter-relationships among
   berry quality parameters are not well understood. The current study
   addresses these issues. Berry and leaf samples at harvest maturity were
   collected from mature field-grown `Shiraz' grapevines grafted with each
   of the rootstocks Dogridge, Freedom, Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen and 140
   Ruggeri. Concentrations of K in juice and petiole and pH in juice were
   each highest for Dogridge and Freedom, but lowest for 140 Ruggeri and
   1103 Paulsen. High concentration of K in juice was related to high
   concentrations of malic acid and TSS but low tartaric acid/malic acid
   ratio. In this study, lower concentrations of K in juice and in turn pH
   in juice of `Shiraz' grapevines were maintained through rootstocks such
   as 140 Ruggeri and 1103 Paulsen that also show lower concentrations of K
   in petiole and TSS in juice, and higher tartaric/malic acid
   concentration ratio in juice at maturity. Selective use of these
   rootstocks in turn helps to produce quality grape juice and wine.},

Abstract = {To determine presence of infection by botryosphaeriaceous fungi in plant
   materials from different grapevine nurseries, different types of grafted
   plants and cuttings were requested from nine grapevine nurseries around
   New Zealand. Of the 311 propagation materials and plants collected, 23
   \% were infected by botryosphaeriaceous fungi. The highest incidence was
   in failed grafted plants (33 \%), followed by Grade 1 plants (28 \%),
   rootstock cuttings (19 \%), scion cuttings (17 \%) and Grade 2 plants (7
   \%). For grafted plants, most isolates (80 \%) were from near the graft
   unions while infections on rootstocks and scion cuttings were mostly
   from the middle (39 \%) and basal parts (46 \%). Identification of
   isolates by morphological and molecular methods showed that seven
   species were present in nurseries, being Neofusicoccum luteum (57 \%),
   N. parvum (18 \%), N. australe (8 \%), Diplodia mutila (8 \%),
   Botryosphaeria dothidea (5 \%) and D. seriata (3 \%), with one novel
   isolate of N. macroclavatum. These results show that Botryosphaeriaceae
   species were present in propagation materials and in the grafted plants
   supplied by nurseries, indicating that some of the current vineyard
   infections may have originated in the propagation nurseries.},

Abstract = {The selection of the most appropriate grape rootstock regarding the
   production purposes has a positive effect on quality of the grape, the
   must and the wine: it may produce higher vintage quantity and may
   increase the vintage quality. Field experiment was set up at the model
   farm of University of Debrecen on sand soil. 12 different grape
   rootstocks were compared (Aramon x Riparia 143B M et de G', `Vitis
   Berlandieri, `Berlandieri x Riparia Szilogyi 157 Pecs', `Berlandieri x
   Riparia S.O.4','Berlandieri x Riparia T5C Eger', `Berlandieri x Riparia

   T.K. 5.BB', `Berlandieri x Riparia K.125AA','Riparia Sauvage', `Riparia
   Selecta', `Riparia Tomentosa). `Cserszegi fliszeres' scion was grafted
   into the above rootstocks. The aim of our research was to determine how
   the B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents of the berry skins change in case of
   the different grape rootstocks. In 2011 we obtained valuable differences
   in the boron, copper, iron, manganese and zinc concentrations of skins
   of `Cserszegi friszeres' grafted into different rootstocks. The
   concentrations of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn changed between 18.0-32.0 mg
   kg(-1), between 1.27-4.77 mg kg(-1), between 11.5-45.0 mg kg(-1),
   between 3.78-14.0 mg kg(-1), and between 2.148.53 mg kg(-1),
   respectively. On the basis of our results the Riparia Sauvage' could be
   an advantageous rootstock, as the largest boron, iron and manganese
   concentrations were found in its skin. Advantageous rootstocks could be
   the `Berlandieri x Riparia Szilagyi 157 Pecs' because of the largest
   measured copper content and the `Vitis Berlandieri' due to the largest
   measured zinc content. These results support that the selection of the
   rootstocks influence the B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents of the grape
   berry.},

Abstract = {Iron is essential to plants for chlorophyll formation as well as for the
   functioning of various iron-containing enzymes. Iron deficiency
   chlorosis is a wide-spread disorder of plants, in particular, of those
   growing on calcareous soils. Among the different ways to control iron
   deficiency problems for crops, plant material and especially rootstock
   breeding is a suitable and reliable method, especially for fruit trees
   and grapes. The aim of the experiment was to characterize the genetic
   basis of grapevine chlorosis tolerance under lime stress conditions. A
   segregating population of 138 F1 genotypes issued from an inter-specific
   cross between Vitis vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon (tolerant) x V. riparia
   Gloire de Montpellier (sensitive) was developed and phenotyped both as
   cuttings and as rootstock grafted with Cabernet Sauvignon scions in pots
   containing non-chlorosing and chlorosing soils. Tolerance was evaluated
   by chlorosis score, leaf chlorophyll content and growth parameters of
   the shoots and roots. The experiments were performed in 2001, 2003 and
   2006. The plants analysed in 2006 were reassessed in 2007. The most
   significant findings of the trial were: (a) the soil properties strongly
   affect plant development, (b) there are differences in tolerance among
   segregating genotypes when grown as cuttings or as rootstocks on
   calcareous soil, (c) calcareous conditions induced chlorosis and
   revealed quantitative trait loci (QTLs) implicated in polygenic control
   of tolerance, (d) rootstock strongly contributes to lime-induced
   chlorosis response, and (e) a QTL with strong effect (from 10 to 25 \%
   of the chlorotic symptom variance) was identified on chromosome 13. This
   QTL colocalized with a QTL for chlorophyll content (R (2) = 22 \%) and a
   major QTL for plant development that explains about 50 \% of both aerial
   and root system biomass variation. These findings were supported by
   stable results among the different years of experiment. These results
   open new insights into the genetic control of chlorosis tolerance and
   could aid the development of iron chlorosis-tolerant rootstocks.},

Abstract = {Adequate yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) levels in grape juice are
   necessary for yeast cells to complete fermentation to dryness. Nitrogen
   (N) uptake by grapevine roots varies seasonally; therefore,
   environmental conditions and cultural practices can affect grapevine N
   status. In addition, genetic differences between rootstock cultivars can
   influence root dynamics and, subsequently, N uptake, canopy biomass, and
   fruit composition. Two rootstock cultivars, 1103P and 101-14 Mgt, were
   fertilized with nitrogen during spring or fall or received no treatment.
   Vine biomass, leaf N concentration, fruit composition, juice amino-N
   levels, and fermentation kinetics were measured. The rootstock 1103
   Paulsen (Vitis berlandieri x V. rupestris cv. 1103P) has a root system
   that tends to produce large canopies and high shoot growth. The
   rootstock 101-14 Millardet et de Grasset (V. riparia x V. rupestris cv.
   101-14 Mgt) has a root system associated with smaller canopies and
   moderate shoot growth. The scion Merlot (V. vinifera L. cv. Merlot clone
   1) was grafted onto the two rootstocks in an experimental block in
   Oakville, California. Merlot on 1103P had higher YAN levels and
   completed fermentation faster compared to Merlot on 101-14 Mgt.
   Differences in fermentation kinetics were observed within rootstock N
   treatments that were not explained by YAN levels, indicating that other
   factors related to N metabolism may play important roles in fermentation
   dynamics. Results indicated that Merlot grown on 1103P in the Napa
   Valley may require little to no N supplementation while Merlot on 101-14
   Mgt may require N supplementation to avoid slow fermentations.},

Abstract = {Complete cluster zone leaf removal of `Pinot noir' was initiated at
   three separate pre-veraison growth stages (bloom, grain-pea size, and
   bunch closure) and maintained leaf free until harvest, for four growing
   seasons (2008-2011). Fruit anthocyanin composition was examined at
   harvest for the last two vintages (2010 and 2011) and compared to a
   control-no cluster zone leaf removal. Experiments were conducted at two
   commercially operating Oregon vineyards (site A = 420 rootstock/'Pinot
   noir' 115 scion and site B = 3309C rootstock/'Pinot noir' 777 scion).
   All clusters contained the five anthocyanins typically found in `Pinot
   noir'. Leaf removal at bloom and maintained until harvest produced
   maximum anthocyanin accumulation in `Pinot noir' grapes (site A = 85.24
   mg/100 g and site B = 125.06 mg/100 g), compared to no leaf removal
   (control: site A = 57.91 mg/100 g and site B = 97.56 mg/100 g). Even
   leaf removal at bunch closure (last leaf removal initiation period)
   increased grape anthocyanin (site A 73.22 mg/bog and site B = 118.93
   mg/100 g) compared to control, but total anthocyanins were lower than
   grapes from bloom leaf removal (first time period). Results differed
   slightly by vineyard site and rootstock/scion combination. Published by

Abstract = {Producers of fruit and nut tree nursery stock need effective weed
   control for maximum production of vigorous, high-grade planting
   material. Current weed practices include methyl bromide fumigation,
   preemergence herbicides, hand labor, and multiple tillage operations. As
   methyl bromide use is phased out due to air quality concerns, and fuel
   and labor costs continue to increase, herbicides are likely to become
   even more important for weed management in the nursery industry. Before
   new herbicides can be registered and used in stonefruit (Prunus sp.)
   tree nurseries, weed control efficacy and crop safety data are needed
   under local conditions. Eleven experiments were conducted from 2007 to
   2011 in California tree nurseries to evaluate the crop safety of
   preemergence (PRE) and postemergence (POST-directed) applications of
   various herbicides on commonly grown peach (Prunus persica), plum
   (Prunus domestica), and peach/plum hybrid rootstocks budded to almond
   (Prunus dulcis) scions. Rootstocks grown from cuttings generally were
   more tolerant to herbicides than those grown from seed. Crop safety was
   adequate in seeded and vegetatively propagated rootstocks with oryzalin,
   pendimethalin, and isoxaben, all of which are labeled for use in tree
   nurseries. The unregistered herbicides, dithiopyr, rimsulfuron,
   oxyfluorfen, and foramsulfuron; as well as lower rates of indaziflam and
   penoxsulam; applied PRE and POST-directed can provide good to excellent
   weed control in some stonefruit rootstocks. However, because slight crop
   injury was occasionally observed, additional work on application rates,
   timing, and method of application, especially on nonlabeled herbicides
   is needed before these materials can be considered for registration and
   broad scale use in tree nurseries.},

Abstract = {Seventy four percent of the budwood tree sources samples from the Greek
   national citrus germplasm foundation collection were positive for one or
   more viroids. Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) and Hop stunt viroid
   (HSVd), the two potentially damaging viroids for the Greek citriculture,
   especially after transitioning to Citrus tristeza virus
   resistant/tolerant rootstocks and scions, were detected along with
   Citrus bark cracking viroid, Citrus bent leaf viroid (CBLVd), and Citrus
   dwarfing viroid (CDVd). All samples tested negative for Citrus viroid V
   (CVd-V), CVd-VI and CVd-I-LSS (CBLVd variant). An HSVd isolate related
   to the non-cachexia variant contained two critical cachexia-related
   nucleotide changes, while two more isolates were unique among the
   previously reported HSVds. Unusual CDVd isolates with altered RNA
   secondary structure were identified in trees additionally co-infected
   with CEVd and HSVd. Budwood sources that had previously undergone
   therapy tested negative for all targeted viroids, suggesting that
   budwood sources in Greece can be protected against graft-transmissible
   pathogens, even under severe inoculum pressure. Therapied and tested
   citrus propagative material requires a comprehensive program not
   available currently in Greece, involving regulators, scientists, and the
   private sector, for the establishment and successful operation of a
   national citrus germplasm collection.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Rootstocks play a major role in grapevine tolerance to water stress by
   controlling and adjusting the water supply to shoot transpiration
   demand. This study aimed to characterize the influence of rootstock
   genotypes in the adaptive response of scions to water limiting
   conditions. The effect of rootstock genotype (140Ru and SO4) was
   observed in the different availability of water provided to the scions
   (Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Merlot, Syrah), while scions influenced
   stomatal control of water transpiration. Implication on the cell-to-cell
   component of plant water transport in both rootstock and scion impacted
   on embolisms formation in roots and on hydraulics of leaves. The main
   conclusion of the present study was that rootstock and scion genotypes
   are able to confer to the plant traits of drought adaptability
   influencing respectively the capacity of water extraction from the soil
   and the sensitivity of the stomata! control. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Detection of black-foot disease pathogens in the grapevine nursery

Volume = {137},
Number = {1},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Two commercial nurseries located in Comunidad Valenciana region
   (central-eastern Spain) were sampled in 2010 to evaluate whether the
   grapevine nursery propagation process could be a source of black-foot
   disease pathogens. Samples were taken from four sources of the
   propagation process: pre-grafting hydration tanks, scissors used for
   cutting buds, omega-cut grafting machines, and peat used for callusing.
   DNA from these samples was extracted and multiplex nested-PCR using
   primers specific for ``Cylindrocarpon{''} pauciseptatum, Ilyonectria
   liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex (composed of I. alcacerensis, I.
   estremocensis, I. macrodidyma, I. novozelandica, I. torresensis, and two
   undescribed species) was used to identify the species present.
   Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex were detected in
   hydration tanks, scissors, grafting machines and peat, I.
   macrodidyma-complex being the most frequent. Additionally, ten grafted
   cuttings each from five grapevine scion/rootstock combinations were
   collected from each nursery immediately after callusing, and again after
   one growing season in a nursery field. Roots of these grafted cuttings
   and plants were sampled to isolate the fungal pathogens. Only I.
   torresensis was isolated after callusing, while I. liriodendri, I.
   novozelandica and I. torresensis were isolated after one growing season,
   showing the highest incidence at this latter sampling time. Moreover,
   DNA was extracted from roots and analyzed as described before.
   Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex were also detected at
   both sampling times. The use of the multiplex nested-PCR technique
   improved the detection of I. liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex from
   grafted cuttings and plants in both nurseries. This work shows that the
   grapevine nursery propagation process should be considered as a
   potential infection source for black-foot disease pathogens, and
   confirms that infections caused by Ilyonectria spp. in grapevine
   planting material increase markedly after one growing season in nursery
   fields.},

Abstract = {Background and AimsAlternative sources of irrigation water can contain
   excess boron. Twenty-six grapevine genotypes were assessed for their
   tolerance to excess boron under non-saline and saline conditions.
   Methods and ResultsRootling vines received one of three irrigation
   treatments: Control (B 0.2mM), Boron (B 0.67mM) or Boron+Salt {[}B
   0.6mM, electrical conductivity 4.0dS/m]. In the Boron treatment, shoot
   growth ranged from 88 to 14\% of that in the Control, and in the
   Boron+Salt from 58 to 10\% of that in the Control. Within genotype
   comparison showed that the growth of shoots in the Boron and Boron+Salt
   treatments was equivalent in 24 genotypes. Genotype did not affect the
   leaf B concentration in the Boron treatment. The addition of salinity
   did not affect the leaf B concentration in 25 genotypes. In 14
   genotypes, the leaf Na+ concentration in the Boron treatment was more
   than double that in the Control. In the Boron and Boron+Salt treatments,
   shoot growth was not correlated with B concentration in the leaf, and in
   the Boron+Salt treatment, it was not correlated with Cl- and Na+
   concentration in the leaf. Boron and Boron+Salt treatments reduced the
   leaf photosynthetic rate and the effective quantum yield of photosystem
   II ((PSII)).
   ConclusionsThere was a large genotypic variation in the tolerance of
   growth to excess boron. It could not be attributed to the variation in
   leaf B concentration.
   Significance of the StudyThe shoot growth in 1613 Couderc and Vitis
   acerifolia under excess boron was equivalent to that in the Control
   treatment, which indicates that the use of these two genotypes as
   rootstocks may produce vines with an improved tolerance to excess boron.},

Title = {Grafting with rootstocks induces extensive transcriptional
   re-programming in the shoot apical meristem of grapevine},
Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Background: Grafting is widely used in the agriculture of fruit-bearing
   crops; rootstocks are known to confer differences in scion biomass in
   addition to improving other traits of agricultural interest. However,
   little is known about the effect of rootstocks on scion gene expression.
   The objective of this study was to determine whether hetero-grafting the
   grapevine variety Vitis vinifera cv. `Cabernet Sauvignon N' with two
   different rootstocks alters gene expression in the shoot apex in
   comparison to the auto-grafted control. Cabernet Sauvignon was
   hetero-grafted with two commercial rootstock genotypes and auto-grafted
   with itself. Vigor was quantified by measurements of root, stem, leaf
   and trunk biomass. Gene expression profiling was done using a whole
   genome grapevine microarray; four pools of five shoot apex samples were
   harvested 4 months after grafting for each scion/rootstock combination.
   Results: The rootstocks increased stem biomass or conferred increased
   vigor by the end of the first growth cycle. Globally hetero-grafting two
   different genotypes together triggered an increase in shoot apex gene
   expression; however no genes were differentially expressed between the
   two hetero-grafts. The functional categories related to DNA, chromatin
   structure, histones, flavonoids and leucine rich repeat containing
   receptor kinases were the most enriched in the up-regulated genes in the
   shoot apex of hetero-grafted plants.
   Conclusions: The choice of rootstock genotype had little effect on the
   gene expression in the shoot apex; this could suggest that auto-and
   hetero-grafting was the major factor regulating gene expression.},

Abstract = {Physio-anatomical traits of rootstock have been considered as
   determinants of vigor in grafted plants. We evaluated how hydraulic
   traits of three Prunus avium cultivars grown on the same rootstock are
   related to tree growth and patterns of biomass allocation between
   vegetative and reproductive parts as well as total water consumption to
   determine how water, as a limiting resource for agriculture, might be
   optimized by choosing appropriate cultivars that are at the same time
   the most successful from the point of view of fruit production. Bing,
   Lapins and Van cultivars growing under field- and well-irrigated
   conditions were selected. Leaf and stem hydraulic conductance (K (Leaf)
   and k (S)), leaf vulnerability to cavitation, water relations traits,
   water use and assimilation and growth rates as well as fruit yield were
   measured. The cultivar with high leaf vulnerability to cavitation and
   low k (S) and sap flow (Lapins) had low vegetative growth, but larger
   fruit production compared to the cultivars with higher k (S), resistance
   to cavitation and water use (Bing and Van). As leaf water potential and
   k (S) were lower and leaves appeared to be embolized in the cultivar
   that had lower carbon allocation to vegetative organs during the
   reproductive period (Lapins), we hypothesize that water instead of
   moving into the leaves is delivered to the fruits, representing the main
   sink for water transport. It is possible that increases in the
   dysfunction of the hydraulic system in the most vulnerable cultivars to
   cavitation during the reproduction stage (Lapins) may represent a signal
   for enhancing the delivery of water to fruits. This information related
   to optimization of crop water use in relation to yield can be useful for
   selecting cultivars with high yield and low water use. This study also
   shows that physiological traits of the scions substantially affect
   growth patterns, fruit production and water relation of the plants.},

Abstract = {The xylem-limited bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) causes Pierce's
   disease (PD), an important disease of grapevine, Vitis vinifera L.
   Grapevine rootstocks were developed to provide increased resistance to
   root disease, but rootstock effects on cane and vine diseases remain
   unclear. Grapevines that consisted of Cabernet Sauvignon or Chardonnay
   grafted to 13 different rootstocks were inoculated with Xf and evaluated
   for PD severity and Xf titer after 6 months. A subset of six
   rootstock/scion combinations had xylem sap phenolic levels assessed in
   non-infected and Xf-infected grapevines. Vigor also was analyzed by
   measuring root lengths and masses. Cabernet Sauvignon grafted to
   101-14MG, 1103P 420A, or Schwarzmann had reduced PD severity compared to
   Cabernet Sauvignon grafted to 110R, 5BB, or SO4. Chardonnay grafted to
   Salt Creek or Freedom had reduced PD severity compared to Chardonnay
   grafted to RS3 or Schwarzmann. Chardonnay grafted to RS3 had greater Xf
   titer than Chardonnay grafted to 101-14MG, Freedom, or Salt Creek. No
   other differences in Xf titer among rootstocks were observed. Of the six
   scion/rootstock combinations which had xylem sap phenolics analyzed,
   Chardonnay/RS3 had the highest levels of most phenolics whereas Cabernet
   Sauvignon/101-14MG had the lowest phenolic levels. However,
   Chardonnay/101-14MG, which had mild PD symptoms, had greater sap levels
   of caftaric acid than other scion/rootstock combinations. Sap levels of
   caftaric acid, methyl salicylate, a procyanidin trimer, and quinic acid
   were greater in Xf-infected vs. non-infected grapevines. Chardonnay on
   101-14MG or Salt Creek had greater root mass than Chardonnay on RS3.
   Cabernet Sauvignon on 101-14MG had greater root mass than Cabernet
   Sauvignon on 110R. These results identified rootstocks with the capacity
   for reducing PD symptom progression. Rootstocks also were shown to
   affect Xf titer, xylem sap phenolic levels, and plant vigor.},

Title = {Improvement of grafting efficiency in hard grafting grape Berlandieri
   hybrid rootstocks by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR)},
Journal = {SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {164},

Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Certain grapevine rootstocks in Vitis berlandieri hybrids (such as 41 B,
   one of the most important rootstocks used in worldwide viticulture) have
   great potential to use owing to its great resistance to calcareous soils
   and phylloxera. But their use is limited due to the difficulties in
   propagation and grafting. PGPR is reported to stimulate division and
   enlargement of plant cells that might result in better fusion at graft
   union point. This investigation was thus conducted to reveal the effects
   of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (Pseudomonas putida strain BA-8,
   Bacillus simplex strain T7) on callus formation, graft success,
   vegetative development and subsequent bud fruitfullness of Alphonse
   Lavallee grape cultivar.
   The green softwood shoots of Alphonse Lavallee (AL) grape were grafted
   on the rootstocks 41 B or 1103 P by modified cleft green-grafting
   technique in controlled glasshouse. Before grafting, the single scion
   nodes were divided into four treatment groups. Three of them were
   separately dipped into bacterial suspension (10(9) CFU ml(-1)) of either
   of two strains or their combination for an hour. One of the treatment
   groups was dipped into the tap water (as control). Each treatment has
   contained thirty grafts, divided into three replicates.
   In both graft combinations, combined application of BA-8 and T7 strains
   resulted in 100\% callusing compared with the uninoculated control where
   the percentages were 93.3 and 90.0\% for AL/41 B and AL/1103 P
   combinations, respectively. Individual or combined applications of the
   strains also had remarkably positive influences on full callusing rates.
   The highest shoot length values were obtained from combined application
   (113.5 cm) and BA-8 strains (100.9 cm) in AL/41 B and AL/1103 P graft
   combinations, respectively. Inoculation of the graft scion parts with
   BA-8 strain resulted in the highest shoot lignification lengths in both
   AL/41 B and AL/1103 P combinations with the values of 75.4 and 75.6 cm,
   respectively while uninoculated grafts of the representing combinations
   were as low as 59.0 and 55.3 cm. In AL/41B, the highest (100\%) graft
   survival rate in nursery was recorded in plants treated with bacterial
   combination. Combined application as well as BA-8 performed better in
   AL/1103P. The findings imply that PGPR can be employed in ecological and
   sustainable production of nursery material and point to the feasibility
   of commercially synthetic auxin replacement by PGPR-based ecological
   treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Persian walnuts are grown over relatively small area within irrigated
   settlements of the Murray Lowlands Province of Southeastern Australia
   compared with traditional crops such as grapes and citrus or emerging
   crops such as almonds. Poor walnut tree health usually associated with
   wrong rootstock selection, or growth in areas with inadequate topsoil
   depth, have inculcated a strong traditional resistance amongst growers
   and horticultural developers to walnuts as a viable alternative crop for
   the region. Recent trials comparing Juglans hindsii, a traditional
   rootstock for the area, with a new selection of Paradox rootstock, have
   shown the Paradox `entity' significantly outperforms J. hindsii in terms
   of scion growth in the first year. The Paradox hybrid has also been
   shown to grow vigorously in soils with shallow topsoil depth above
   calcareous B horizon subsoils. This suitability of the Paradox hybrid to
   calcareous soils provides the potential to expand the walnut industry
   into parts of the Murray Lowland Province characterized by Calcarosol
   soils with as little as 30 cm topsoil.},

Abstract = {The boundary line concept was used to assess grapevine responses to
   salinity-associated soil variables. Soil chemical status and grapevine
   responses were measured in 13 vineyards in the Breede River Valley
   during the 2001/2002 season. Chardonnay grafted onto 110R and 101-14
   Mgt, as well as Ruby Cabernet on the same two rootstocks, was included.
   The selected vineyards were representative of the variation in
   salinity-associated soil variables, as well as of leaf and juice element
   contents previously reported for South African vineyards. Under the
   prevailing conditions, the four scion-rootstock combinations responded
   similarly to the salinity-associated variables. The results confirm that
   soil pH((KCl)) should be at least 6.0 for grapevines. The salinity
   threshold for vineyards in the Breede River Valley should be between 0.7
   dS/m and 1.5 dS/m to avoid growth and yield reductions. To reduce the
   risk of Na toxicity, the SAR should be below 3, and the soluble Na
   content in the soil should not exceed 5 mg/kg. If gypsum is used to
   reduce soil Na, it should be applied judiciously to avoid soil SO4
   accumulation, thereby reducing the risk of K and Mg deficiencies. Under
   the prevailing conditions, B and Cl toxicity apparently contributed to
   reduced vegetative growth. Therefore, soil Cl and B should be kept as
   low as possible, but care should be taken that B is not reduced to
   deficient levels. The boundary line concept proved to be useful for
   determining the effect of a single salinity-associated soil variable on
   grapevine response.},

   similar to 30\% of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from budburst to
   fruit set, 13-15\% from fruit set to veraison and 20\% from veraison to
   harvest. RDI-2 and PRI-2 vines received around 20\% of ETc from budburst
   to fruit set, no irrigation from fruit set to veraison, and recovery
   (21-24\% ETc) thereafter. Compared with RDI-1, PRI-1 increased
   irrigation depth and total soil water (theta(v)) availability in the
   root zone, and stimulated greater fine root growth and water uptake.
   Increased soil volume exploration supported greater canopy water use,
   vegetative development, biomass accumulation and internal water storage
   capacity. PRI-1 vines had higher stomatal conductance, lower leaf-level
   water use efficiency and increased leaf xylem sap concentration
   ({[}X-ABA](leaf)) following reirrigation. Compared with RDI-2, PRI-2
   decreased total theta(v) availability, fine root growth and water
   uptake, gas exchange, leaf water status, {[}X-ABA](leaf), biomass
   accumulation and storage capacity. Xylem ABA decreased with total
   theta(v) availability in PRI-2, probably from limited sap flow when
   theta(v) in drying soil was low (approximate to 20\%). For this
   rootstock-scion combination, high irrigation volumes applied to the wet
   part of the roots (theta(v) > 30\%) are critical for increasing
   root-to-shoot ABA signalling and growth, and improving performance under
   semiarid conditions.},

Abstract = {The double cropping system has been commercially adopted in subtropical
   viticulture regions. However, very limited information about rootstock
   and seasonal effects on berry quality traits are available for this
   unique production system. Developing `Kyoho' berries from own-rooted
   vines and from vines on 5C and 1202C rootstocks were periodically
   sampled from veraison until harvest in two consecutive cropping cycles
   to document the potential seasonal influence on rootstock effects.
   Anthocyanin concentration in berry skin, total soluble solids content
   (TSS), and titratable acidity (TA) were analyzed. In both cropping
   cycles, own-rooted vines produced berries with the highest anthocyanin
   concentration while vines on 1202C produced berries with the lowest
   anthocyanin concentration among the three scion/rootstocks. Anthocyanin
   concentrations were not differentiated by the differential climate
   pattern between the summer and the winter cropping cycles. Berries of
   own-rooted `Kyoho' and `Kyoho'/5C vines accumulated satisfactory and
   equal amount of TSS in both cropping cycles. 1202C rootstocks did not
   affect berry TSS in the summer cropping cycle but reduced TSS in the
   winter cropping cycle. Significant rootstock and seasonal effects on
   berry TA were detected. Own-rooted vines produced berries with the
   lowest TA while vines on 1202C produced berries with the highest TA
   among the three scion/rootstock combinations. TA of berries from the
   winter cropping cycle was significantly higher than that from the summer
   cropping cycle especially in `Kyoho'/1202C. Relationships between
   anthocyanins and TSS of developing berries after veraison properly
   fitted into a sigmoidal function regardless of rootstocks and cropping
   cycles. However, the duration of the initial lag phase, the onset and
   the trend of both quality triats in the increasing phase, and the
   presence and degree of the final lag phase in the relationship were all
   modulated by rootstocks and by seasonal variations.},

Abstract = {Grapevine rootstock breeding commenced in the 1970s at the Georgikon
   Faculty of Pannon University by utilizing genetic resources from a
   collection of more than 110 rootstock genotypes. The main aim was to
   develop highly lime tolerant rootstocks, because about half of Hungary's
   grape growing regions suffer from lime-induced iron chlorosis. The lime
   content in some of these soils even precludes the use of the Teleki
   rootstocks. Ease of propagation was also selected for. `Georgikon 28'
   one of the main/first results of these early efforts. This rootstock has
   an extremely high lime tolerance and it is easy to propagate, but
   because of its V. vinifera genetic background its phylloxera resistance
   is only moderate and needs to be strengthened. As the program progressed
   drought tolerance was also added to the breeding goals. Seedling
   populations were established in the mid-1990s after parents had been
   characterized and selected; their evaluation still continues. The
   drought tolerance of `Georgikon 28' x `Borner' seedlings is discussed in
   detail. Field performance of this seedling population was evaluated in a
   rootstock mother block and in a trial vineyard using standard rootstock
   cultivars as controls. Results presented are from 2011 and 2012. Both
   growing season were extremely dry. Harvested cane production in a
   rootstock mother block was used as an easy and efficient indicator of
   rootstock productivity to select promising candidates among the
   seedlings. The performance of grafted plants was judged by the fruit
   quality (number of clusters, berry size, yield per stock, berry weight,
   sugar content, acidity) and pruning weight in the vineyard. The most
   promising genotypes produced higher yield, with better quality in 2012
   than the same scions grafted on `1103 Paulsen', `Fercal' or `Georgikon
   28' and their cane production were satisfactory as well.},

Abstract = {The effect of flooding on young grapevine plants grafted onto two
   rootstocks: Harmony and Freedom was evaluated. Grafted and non-grafted
   plants were grown in plastic pots under normal and flooding conditions.
   Flooding condition was obtained by keeping the water three cm above the
   soil and the oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) was 0.2 mu g O-2 cm(-2)
   min(-1): In control ODR was 1.7 mu g O-2 cm(-2) min(-1). Net CO2
   assimilation and stomata conductance were evaluated in developing and
   mature leaves. In general, at the beginning of flooding, plants grafted
   on Harmony showed a rapid reduction in net CO2 assimilation. This
   reduction reached a minimum after at seven days of flooding treatment.
   By contrast, the plant grafted on Freedom did not show any reduction on
   net CO2 assimilation until seven days of flooding. This indicates that
   this last rootstock confers to the scion a tolerance to hypoxia. On the
   other hand, the reduction in net CO2 assimilation was well correlated
   with dry matter production and leaf area in both rootstocks. Harmony
   grafted plants presented the highest reduction (54\%) in dry matter
   accumulation, while Freedom grafted plants presented 36\% of reduction.
   After the flooding treatment, a significant increase in the accumulation
   of P was found in plants grafted on Harmony. This raises questions on
   the role of this element in the plant metabolism under low oxygen
   conditions. Finally, after the results obtained in dry matter reduction
   under flooding condition, we conclude that in `Sultanina' grafted
   plants, Freedom rootstock induced a better tolerance to hypoxia than
   Harmony.},

Abstract = {Soils in some major Australian viticultural regions are generally high
   in potassium content, which is in contrast to viticultural regions in
   other parts of the world. There is a considerable body of evidence, both
   from commercial experiences and research results, that the widely
   adopted high vigour, root-knot nematode tolerant rootstock varieties
   contribute to negative impacts on wine quality associated with high
   potassium uptake, high pH and malate levels. Previous findings have
   shown that in a given year, grafted vine grape juice pH at harvest is
   highly correlated with the ungrafted rootstock petiole potassium level
   at anthesis. We demonstrated that this relationship is also present when
   multiple years of juice pH and ungrafted rootstocks petioles are
   compared. The mean harvest pH of `Chardonnay' grafted on 6 commercial
   rootstocks from 4 vineyards over two consecutive years had a strong
   correlation (adjusted R-2= 0.755) with the 2 year mean potassium content
   of the ungrafted rootstocks in the field. Likewise, the 8 year mean pH
   of a rootstock trial with 5 commercial rootstock and 14 experimental
   rootstocks with `Shiraz' scions was highly correlated (adjusted R-2=
   0.502) with the 2 year mean petiole potassium content of the ungrafted
   field grown rootstocks. To facilitate accelerated breeding of new
   rootstocks, we have developed a glasshouse based assay for the early
   selection of rootstocks with low potassium transport to aerial tissues.
   We demonstrated that the 8 year mean juice pH of grafted vines is also
   correlated with the ungrafted vine petiole potassium content for plants
   grown in the glasshouse with supplemented levels of potassium (adjusted
   R-2= 0.501). In addition, we are also screening vines in the glasshouse
   for resistance to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica. We are
   currently screening potential and commercial germplasm for resistance to
   M. javanica, and have identified a Vitis cinerea accession that
   transmits resistance as a single dominant gene.},

Abstract = {Irrigated agriculture is the world's largest consumer of fresh water.
   With a growing global demand for horticultural products and decreasing
   fresh water availability, improving the water use efficiency of
   irrigated horticultural crops has clear benefits for industry and
   society.
   Rootstocks are used in many crops and offer a potential mechanism to
   alter canopy processes for a given scion, particularly relevant in
   viticulture, where the scion is strongly associated with the product.
   Rootstocks may affect vine canopy function in various ways, most notably
   by altering scion vigour. Changes in scion growth have a direct impact
   on whole plant transpiration and yield, with potential effects on fruit
   quality. Rootstocks may also alter canopy responses to the environment,
   particularly to soil moisture.
   Through the use of a field trial with mature vines, we have examined the
   role rootstock selection has in determining canopy size, plant water
   use, crop yield and crop quality in winegrapes. We have determined that
   rootstock selection can alter both crop yield per unit of water
   transpired (crop water use index: CWUI) and the response of canopy
   physiology to a given soil environment.
   Assessment of current rootstocks for specific traits that impact CWUI
   and targeting future rootstock breeding towards these traits will
   provide improved rootstocks and improved horticultural practice.},

Abstract = {Grape berry components are important because they determine the quality
   of the grape and are the most important parameter for the quality of
   wine. These components depend on a complex interaction between two
   genotypes (rootstock and scion) and other environmental factors. Climate
   change affects the physiology of the vine, yield and fruit composition,
   and ultimately the quality and authenticity of wines. In this context,
   we need to better understand the physiological mechanism and the genetic
   background underlying the interaction between viticulture and the
   environment, as this will be helpful for the development of sustainable
   concepts under changing conditions.
   We studied the interactions of two grapevine rootstocks (110R
   drought-tolerant and 125AA drought-sensitive) and two water regimes
   (well-watered and moderate water stressed) on grape berry composition of
   Pinot noir. These interactions are studied by integrating analysis of
   secondary metabolites, enzymes involved in primary and secondary
   metabolism, and gene expression. The transcriptional and metabolic
   profiling complemented with biochemical data of four developmental
   stages from berries still hard and green, through veraison to mature
   berries (EL 33, EL 35, EL 36, EL 38) and in three seasons (2009, 2010
   and 2011) will be compared. The results will provide new information of
   the response of grape berry quality to rootstock and to drought.},

Abstract = {The variation in potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) accumulation was
   investigated between 60 hybrids within a family obtained by crossing
   grapevine rootstocks K 51-40 (Vitis champinii `Dogridge' x V. riparia
   `Gloire', seed parent) with 140 Ruggeri (V. cinerea var. helleri
   `Resseguier \#2' x V. rupestris `St. George', pollen parent), which are
   known to result in higher and lower concentrations of K+, respectively,
   but similar concentrations of Na+, in grape juice and resultant wine
   from scions grafted to them. The hybrids, their parents and two standard
   rootstocks, Ramsey (V champinii `Ramsey') and 1103 Paulsen (V. cinerea
   var. helleri `Resseguier \#2' x V rupestris `St. George') were
   replicated by clonal propagation and grown under glasshouse conditions
   either in potting mix, drip-irrigated with a nutrient solution
   containing 50, 1.7 and 30 mM Cl-, K+ and Na+, respectively, or in
   aerated nutrient solution containing 25, 1.7 and 15 mM Cl-, K+ and Na+,
   respectively. In both pot and solution culture trials, there were
   significant (P < 0.001) differences between parents for mean K+ (but not
   Na+) concentrations, and between hybrids for mean K+ and Na+
   concentrations in laminae. This variation between the hybrids was
   continuous, indicating multiple rather than single gene control for K+
   and Na+ accumulation within the family. Differences among the hybrids
   for lamina K+ accumulation were not strongly associated with plant
   vigour. While the ranking of some hybrids for K+ and Na+ accumulation
   was consistent between the trials, others responded differently,
   suggesting the environment of the rootzone may affect the K+ and Na+
   accumulation phenotype.},

   six scion varieties were inoculated with mycelium of three isolates each

   Overall results showed that all isolates produced necrotic lesions on
   all varieties but susceptibility varied significantly (P < 0.001) with
   5C and SO4 being the most susceptible of the rootstock varieties, and
   Merlot and Pinot noir being the most susceptible of the scions.
   Pathogenicity also varied significantly (P < 0.001) between species with
   N. parvum being the most virulent among three species tested. This study
   has further shown that different isolates of the three species have
   different levels of virulence providing evidence that these pathogens
   are genetically diverse. These results have significant implications for
   the New Zealand grapevine industry as the use of resistant varieties is
   not a possible option at present since none of the common varieties are
   resistant to these pathogens.},

Abstract = {Members of the Botryosphaeriaceae family are known to cause Bot gummosis
   on many woody plants worldwide. To identify pathogens associated with
   Bot gummosis on citrus in California, scion and rootstock samples were
   collected in 2010 and 2011 from five citrus-growing counties in
   California. Symptoms observed on citrus included branch cankers,
   dieback, and gumming. Various fungal species were recovered from
   necrotic tissues of branch canker and rootstock samples. Species were
   identified morphologically and by phylogenetic comparison as `Eureka'
   lemon, `Valencia', `Washington Navel', `Fukumoto', grapefruit,
   `Satsuma', and `Meyer' lemon. Species were identified morphologically
   and by phylogenetic comparison of the complete sequence of the internal
   transcribed spacer regions, (beta-tubulin gene, and elongation factor
   alpha-1 genes with those of other species in GenBank. A
   consensus-unrooted most parsimonious tree resulting from multigene
   phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of three major clades in the
   Botryosphaeriaceae family. In total, 74 isolates were identified
   belonging to the Botryosphaeriaceae family, with Neofusicoccum spp.,
   Dothiorella spp., Diplodia spp., (teleomorph Botryosphaeria),
   Lasiodiplodia spp., and Neoscytalidium dimidiatum (teleomorphs unknown)
   accounting for 39, 25, 23, 10, and 3\% of the total, respectively. On
   inoculated Eureka lemon shoots, lesion length was significantly
   different (P < 0.05) among 14 isolates recovered from portions of
   cankered tissues of the original trees. Lesion lengths were
   significantly longer (P < 0.05) for shoots inoculated with isolates of
   Neofusicoccum luteum and shorter for shoots inoculated with isolates of
   Dothiorella viticola (P < 0.05) than those of other species. Identifying
   the distribution and occurrence of these fungal pathogens associated
   with Bot gummosis is useful for management applications during
   occasional outbreaks in California.},

Abstract = {Thompson Seedless' grapes grafted on five rootstocks and own-rooted
   vines were evaluated for yield, fruit composition, and raisin recovery
   percentage. Biochemical constituents were analyzed in fresh grapes
   before drying into raisins and also in raisins. Among different
   rootstocks, raisin recovery was highest in `Thompson Seedless' grapes
   grafted on 110 R followed by those on `Dogridge', 1103 P and 99 R.
   Significant differences were observed in total proteins, reducing
   sugars, phenol contents, and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in both
   fresh grapes and raisins made from all rootstock scion combinations.
   Increase in the content of proteins and reducing sugars was observed in
   raisins compared to fresh grapes. However, there was a reduction in
   phenolic concentrations in raisins compared to fresh grapes. PPO
   activity was highest in `Thompson Seedless' grapes grafted on
   `Dogridge', while it was least in 110 R.},

Pages = {108-113},
Abstract = {Amongst 60 species within the Vitis genus, Vitis vinifera L. is the
   mostly used species for the production of wine and distilled liquors.
   Before the devastation of European viticulture caused by the
   introduction of phylloxera from North America, varieties of V. vinifera
   used commercially for wine production in Europe were traditionally grown
   on their own roots. Subsequently, the use of rootstocks from the pest's
   origin was introduced to provide resistance to this and other
   deleterious diseases and to save the fate of European viticulture.
   Rootstocks have been bred from a number of Vitis species and are known,
   in addition to the enhanced resistance to phylloxera and other
   pathogens, confer tolerance to abiotic stresses (e.g. drought, high
   salinity and Fe-deficiency) and to alter specific aspects of
   harvest/postharvest fruit quality of a scion. This review summarizes
   recent data related to the responses of grapevine rootstocks to abiotic
   stresses, with particular attention to drought, salinity and iron
   chlorosis.},

Abstract = {The Florida Citrus Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) Project was
   initiated by applying three soil tillage (mixing) treatments: shallow
   tillage (ST), deep tillage (DT), and deep tillage plus lime (DTL) to
   nine blocks on a Spodosol (Oldsmar fine sandy loam) at the University of
   Florida Indian River Research and Education Center. Each block had six
   subsurface plastic drain lines, three adjacent drains were submerged and
   three adjacent drains were open. `Pineapple' sweet orange and `Marsh'
   grapefruit scions on six rootstocks were transplanted from the nursery
   in November 1970. Yields were measured from 1973-74 to 1984-85 by scion,
   rootstock, tillage treatment, subsurface drain type, and replication. At
   the end of 12 harvests, cumulative yields of `Pineapple' orange were
   greatest for rough lemon, Rangpur lime, and Cleopatra mandarin
   rootstocks, intermediate for sour orange and Carrizo citrange, and
   lowest for Poncirus trifoliata rootstocks. The last survey of tree
   health was conducted in November 1984. The healthiest trees were on
   Cleopatra mandarin rootstock. Rough lemon had the most trees with blight
   symptoms. Sour orange had the most trees with Tristeza. Rangpur lime and
   rough lemon had some foot rot. Carrizo citrange and Poncirus trifoliata
   had the most water damage symptoms. Yields were related to tree health.},

Abstract = {Citrus crop are very sensitive to salinity, but their actual response
   may depend on several factors, among them the species used as scion.
   When growers have to choose a species for planting they need to know how
   it will behave in salt stress situations. The aim of this experiment was
   to evaluate the behaviour of two citrus species `Clemenules' mandarin
   (CLM) and `Star Ruby' grapefruit (SR), both grafted on `Cleopatra'
   mandarin rootstock, to establish their relative salt tolerance. The
   experiment was carried out over a 3 year period (2008-2010) in the IMIDA
   experimental farm located in Torre Pacheco (Murcia) using 15-year-old
   trees irrigated with 2 treatments: 0 mM NaCl and 40 mM NaCl. After the
   application of saline water for 3 consecutive years, the species
   revealed a different behaviour in response to salinity. Higher leaf
   Cl-and Na+ concentrations were observed in SR, which led to an important
   nutritional imbalance in the trees. The high leaf Na+ concentration in
   SR salinized-trees produced an antagonistic effect on leaf K+
   concentrations. The salinity applied also produced a different response
   in the vegetative growth parameters of each species. SR was more
   affected by salinity in this respect, showing a substantial degree of
   defoliation during the first year. However, the leaf biomass of the
   trees gradually recovered from the second year onwards, pointing to
   signs of salinity acclimation. In CLM, on the other hand, leaf density
   was hardly affected by salinity during the three years of the
   experiment. The total accumulated yield ( 20082010) was only reduced by
   salinity in SR trees, mainly as a result of reduced fruit weight,
   although a lower fruit load was also observed in 2009. As regards fruit
   quality, salinity increased total soluble solids and acidity in both
   species, without affecting the maturity index. The external peel colour
   of SR fruit was greener as a result of salinity.},

Abstract = {Viral infections in grapevines cause physiological disorders that lead
   to foliar deformations, alterations in the berry color and finally
   reductions in productivity. Most viral infections in grapevine are
   disseminated by biological vectors and then by the vegetative
   propagation of infected material. More than 10 viruses commonly infect
   the grapevine, and it is not rare to find two or three different viruses
   in one infected plant. There are no efficient chemical treatments
   against virus infections. A molecular strategy to induce virus
   resistance in plants is gene silencing. This strategy requires the
   transformation of plants with a short sequence of the pathogen in a way
   that a double-strand RNA structure is formed during transcription,
   initiating gene silencing in the host. The objective of this work was
   the induction of virus silencing in grapevine rootstocks in order to use
   them for grafting. It is expected that the mobile silencing signal would
   induce virus silencing in the scion. We have transformed rootstocks (110
   Richter and Harmony) by co-culturing embryogenic and organogenic tissues
   with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying a silencing vector containing a
   sequence of the coat protein of Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV).
   Twenty-six transgenic plants of the 110 Richter rootstock have been
   recovered, analyzed by RT-PCR for the GFLV sequence, and propagated to
   obtain several plants of each line. The transgenic rootstocks have been
   grafted with GFLV-infected plants that were positive for virus presence
   by RT-PCR analysis. Once the grafts were set, GFLV detection was carried
   out with scions using primers for the movement protein. After one month
   the detection of the virus was abolished in the scion, with three of six
   analyzed rootstock lines.},

Abstract = {Water scarcity is a key limiting factor in agriculture. Grapevines react
   at the physiological, biochemical and genetic level to tolerate water
   constraints. Even though grapevines are considered relatively tolerant
   to water deficits, grapevine growth and yield can be seriously reduced
   under water deficit. Drought-tolerant rootstocks are expected to enable
   the scion to grow and yield when water supply is limited. Genetic
   machinery allows rootstocks to control water extraction capacity and
   scion transpiration. Numerous works have demonstrated the positive role
   of drought-tolerant rootstocks on the control of cultivar's leaf
   stomatal conductance and therefore on canopy transpiration. The
   mechanisms, in terms of signalisation and gene functioning, need further
   study. Furthermore, there is no standardised methodology to rank
   rootstocks in terms of their tolerance to drought. A potential effect of
   rootstocks on stomatal development is also discussed. This review will
   critically discuss the current knowledge of the mechanisms of drought
   tolerance afforded by rootstocks, taking into account the
   scion/rootstock interaction, and will present some of the challenges for
   future investigations.},

Abstract = {As the home of numerous grape genotypes, Turkey is one of the major
   centers of viniculture genetic material in the world. Merzifon Karasi'
   (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the most valuable red wine grape cultivars
   in Turkey. However, despite the variety's relative age, Merzifon Karasi'
   has yet to be tested on different rootstocks. Therefore, this study was
   conducted to determine the effects of different rootstocks on the growth
   characteristics of Merzifon Karasi' scion. Growth parameters (shoot
   length (cm), shoot diameter (mm), internode length (cm), total and unit
   leaf area (cm(2)), root length (cm), root scale (0-4) and root number)
   were calculated and carbohydrate content (\%) of the grafted grapevine
   shoots, trunk and roots analysed for 9 different rootstocks. Significant
   differences (P < 0.01) were found among rootstocks. 8B and Rupestris du
   Lot rated best in terms of root length, root scale and root number (P <
   0.01). Highest shoot length, shoot diameter (P < 0.01) and internode
   length were obtained, respectively, with the 110R, 8B and Rupestris du
   Lot rootstocks (P < 0.05). Rupestris du Lot also produced the grapevines
   with the highest total leaf area per plant and main shoot, whereas the
   grapevines grafted on 8B had the highest unit leaf area (P < 0.01).
   Sugar, starch and carbohydrate contents (\%) of the different plant
   parts also varied significantly by root-stock (P < 0.01), with the
   highest root carbohydrate content measured in the 5C (22.4 \%)
   rootstock, and the highest trunk and shoot carbohydrate content measured
   in the 110R (12.1 and 13.4\%, respectively). In sum, the study found the
   best rootstocks for Merzifon Karasi' to be 8B, Rupestris du Lot and 110R
   in terms of root and shoot growth, whereas `Merzifon Karasi' grape
   grafted onto 110R and 5C rootstock had the highest carbohydrate
   contents.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {409-421},

Abstract = {Background and AimsGrape berry growth and composition depend on complex
   interactions between the genotypes of the rootstock and the scion,
   vineyard management and environmental factors. The present work aimed to
   characterise the effect of rootstock genotype and water deficit on the
   primary and secondary metabolism of the grape berry.
   Methods and ResultsVitis vinifera cv. Pinot Noir grafted on either
   rootstock 110R (drought tolerant, mid to high vigour) or 125AA (drought
   sensitive, high vigour) was studied during three growing seasons in the
   field under normal rainfall or water shortage conditions. Water status,
   yield and berry composition (sugars, organic acids, free amino acids and
   anthocyanins) were measured throughout berry development during the
   three growing seasons. Water stress did not significantly affect berry
   mass, yield, sugar and organic acids concentration, but increased
   anthocyanin concentration of the berries regardless of the rootstock.
   Furthermore, the data showed that the berry amino acid concentration at
   harvest depended on interactions between water supply and rootstocks.
   ConclusionsScion berry composition differed only slightly between the
   two rootstocks tested. Rootstocks and water stress, however, affected
   the concentration of amino acids, and plants grafted onto 125AA were
   more sensitive to drought stress.
   Significance of the StudyThis work provides novel insights into the
   response of grape berry metabolites to rootstock and to drought in a

Abstract = {Background and AimsThe effect of rootstock on chloride (Cl-) and sodium
   (Na+) exclusion capacity and yield of Chardonnay and Shiraz was
   investigated in the final 2 years (2007/08 and 2008/09) of a long-term
   (14-year) saline irrigation trial.
   Methods and ResultsChardonnay and Shiraz, on own roots and on nine
   rootstocks, were irrigated for the first 12 seasons with water of
   electrical conductivity (ECiw) of 2.1dS/m, with 7.15ML/ha the mean total
   applied. The final two seasons were years of water restrictions, where
   the vines were irrigated with water of (mean) ECiw of 1.65dS/m at a
   seasonal application of 3.04ML/ha. Vines on own roots had a relatively
   low yield, for example 2.0kg/vine (Chardonnay) and 8.8kg/vine (Shiraz),
   and a high concentration of both chloride and sodium in grape juice
   (>1000mg/L for Chardonnay and >500mg/L for Shiraz). Ramsey and 1103
   Paulsen rootstocks produced a high yield of 11-12kg/vine with
   Chardonnay, and Ramsey and C7 produced a high yield of 23.5-24.5kg/vine
   with Shiraz. Chardonnay on C5 and Shiraz on C7 rootstocks had the lowest
   concentration of grape juice chloride and sodium (in each case <50mg/L).
   ConclusionsYield, a measure of salt tolerance, was positively correlated
   with rootstock-conferred vigour, measured by scion pruning mass. Neither
   yield nor pruning mass correlated with the concentration of either
   chloride or sodium in grape juice or in trunk wood, except that Shiraz
   yield correlated negatively with trunk wood Cl-.
   Significance of the StudyThis is the first long-term (>10 years) study
   to compare the effect of rootstocks on the tolerance of Chardonnay and
   Shiraz to salinity.},

Abstract = {One of the main objectives of wine grape growers in several viticultural
   areas throughout history has been the achievement of full ripening, i.e.
   maximum soluble solids concentration in the absence of apparent berry
   shrinkage. Recently, this target is somewhat losing its appeal since an
   increasing number of consumers from both domestic and foreign markets
   prefer lighter wines characterized by moderate alcohol content. The
   above scenario needs to be added of another actor, i.e. the global
   warming and its effects on vine growth and berry composition which can
   be summarized as it follows: (i) onset of flowering and veraison
   phenological stages occurs earlier; (ii) grape ripening is generally
   accelerated as per increment of sugar accumulation into the berries
   which, in turn, leads to higher alcohol content in the wine; (iii)
   faster depletion of organic acids in the juice and more rapid increase
   of pH values which, as a consequence, triggers high microbiological
   instability of the must during pre-fermentation; (iv) due to excessive
   heat summations and poor thermal excursion the overall aroma profile can
   result untypical shifting towards overripe; (v) uncoupling of
   technological (more accelerated) and phenolic (more delayed) ripening
   with negative effects on grape and wine aroma and flavor, especially in
   red grape varieties; (vi) higher frequency of berry withering up to sun
   burn damage. In the medium-to-long term these factors likely will affect
   the geographical distribution of viticulture and will require new
   breeding programs for selecting more adapted roostocks and scions,
   whereas in the short term, new management techniques able to mitigate
   these negative impacts are urgently needed. In this review, several
   tools including varietal and clonal choice, possible diversification of
   wines produced, suitable training system and rootstocks, traditional and
   innovative management techniques able to regulate a too much accelerated
   and/or unbalanced grape ripening process, will be presented and
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   performed in the 2011, 2012 and 2013 seasons, covered the duration of
   their phenological cycles, shoot growth, yield per plant, estimated
   total yield and physicochemical characteristics. Differences were found
   between clones in terms of phenology, yield components, and berry
   composition. Clone 6 had the lowest yield, averaging 5.0 t ha(-1)
   whereas clone 13 was the most productive with 14.9 t ha(-1). Based on
   the most productive vineyards in the region (10.8 t ha(-1)), the
   adoption of more productive clones can generate an increase in yield of
   around 38 \%.},

   phylloxera ``(Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch)},
Journal = {VITIS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},

Pages = {137-142},
Abstract = {By parasitizing the roots of Vitis species, grape phylloxera
   (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch, Phylloxeridae) is one of the most
   devastating pests in viticulture. Grafting susceptible scions (Vitis
   vinifera) to tolerant Vitis rootstocks is a common practice to control
   grape phylloxera in wine growing regions worldwide. However, grape
   phylloxera populations still develop on the roots of most grafting
   combinations. Questions remain as to whether or not the impact of
   environmental factors on grape phylloxera population dynamics is related
   to Vitis rootstock cultivars. In the presented field study, we
   investigated the influence of two closely related mature Vitis
   berlandieri x Vitis riparia rootstock varieties on the relations between
   the dynamics of root feeding grape phylloxera populations, root
   morphology and abiotic factors. The investigation took place on a
   commercial vineyard in Geisenheim/Germany on Teleki 5C/V vinifera
   `Weisser Riesling' and Kober 125AA/V. vinifera `Weisser Riesling'.
   Samples of roots, attached grape phylloxera populations and soil were
   taken in the field 19 times between August 2007 and August 2009. Grape
   phylloxera population structure was recorded by the occurrence of
   root-feeding wingless females, fundatrices and nymphs and the
   pigmentation and position of root galls were assessed. Root
   morphological parameters were assessed using WinRhizo Pro. Soil abiotic
   parameters were assessed in the laboratory. Results of a principal
   component analysis showed rootstock related differences considering the
   impact of abiotic factors on grape phylloxera population structure.
   Especially soil temperature and soil organic matter were indicated to
   have a lower impact on grape phylloxera population structure on roots of
   5C than on roots of 125AA. Our data indicate that ecological factors
   have a lower impact on the development of grape phylloxera on more
   supportive rootstocks.},

Abstract = {Citrus is an economically important world tree fruit crop with
   production in more than 146 countries. The center of origin for citrus
   is considered to be Southeastern Asia including southern China,
   northeastern India, and Malaysia, with secondary centers in surrounding
   areas. Novel and commercially significant scion and rootstock cultivars
   originating by natural mutation or directed hybridization were
   introduced during the past century. Significant genetic resource
   collections exist in many countries. A global citrus germplasm network
   was developed in 1997. Now that the International Treaty on Plant
   Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGR) has recognized Citrus
   as an Annex 1 crop, a global conservation strategy needs to be
   established. The objective of this workshop was to plan the development
   of this strategy. More than 60 delegates attended with representation
   from Argentina, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, China, Columbia, France,
   Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Turkey,
   UAE, US, and Vietnam. Nine oral presentations were given describing
   multiple aspects of genebank operations, technologies and gaps in
   Brazil, China, France, Australia, Spain, and the US. A draft genebank
   survey questionnaire was presented to the group and comments and
   suggested changes for improvement were received. Citrus curators and
   genebank managers throughout the world will be surveyed for the status
   and health of their collections. The surveys will be received and
   compiled by collaborators at the University of California, Riverside,
   and at the USDA ARS Riverside. This information will be compiled and
   reported. The strategy will include background and history of the
   development of Citrus as a cultivated crop, conservation protocols,
   vulnerabilities, and recommendations for safeguarding Citrus germplasm.
   This strategy will be implemented through the Global Crop Diversity
   Trust with collaboration from the International Society for
   Horticultural Science and the international Citrus research community.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive citrus breeding and genetics program was established at
   the UF/CREC during the mid-1980s combining conventional breeding with
   tools provided by tissue culture, emerging biotechnologies, molecular
   genetics and genomics. Scion Improvement: The Florida citrus industry is
   90\% processing sweet oranges. A major goal has been to develop new
   cultivars for Not From Concentrate (NFC) juice production with emphasis
   on increasing juice quality and expanding seasonal availability.
   Improved clones from seedling introductions, budwood irradiation and
   somaclonal variation will be discussed. The fresh fruit industry in
   Florida is dominated by grapefruit and seedy mandarins. Primary
   objectives for fresh fruit improvement include expanding seasonal
   availability, development of canker tolerant and low furanocoumarin
   grapefruit, and development of seedless, easy-peel mandarins. The focus
   of our program has been on parent development, and seedless triploid
   production via interploid crosses; strategies and successes will be
   discussed. Rootstock Improvement: Initial focus was on improving soil
   adaptation, tree-size control to facilitate harvesting and
   cold-protection, and disease resistance, especially to blight,
   CTV-induced quick decline and Phytophthora. Breeding objectives have
   since been expanded to include tolerance of the Diaprepes/Phytophthora
   complex and Huanglongbing HLB, and development of rootstocks that
   facilitate advanced citrus production systems (ACPS). Progress from
   conventional breeding (both 2x and 4x) and somatic hybridization will be
   discussed. Genetic Engineering: Due to the HLB and canker epidemics,
   focus has been on disease resistance gene discovery, transformation, and
   evaluation of transgenic plants; progress will be discussed.},

   primers PIN1 and PIN2 directed to the conserved 3' untranslated region.
   Results show the presence of CTV in the three states surveyed while
   symptom severity differed from one location to another. Disease
   incidence varied from 85.2\% in Oyo State to 48.4\% in Ogun State.
   Citrus trees were infected regardless of scion-rootstock combinations

Abstract = {The citrus industry is one of the most relevant segments of the
   Brazilian agribusiness, being responsible for 40\% of the sweet orange
   production and 60\% of the juice processing in the World. Some factors
   for this hegemony are the adequate ecological conditions, which allows
   for cultivation without irrigation, and huge land availability. Threats,
   however, exist especially at the core of national production, in the
   State of Sao Paulo. The most important, bacterial and virus diseases,
   appear with increasingly incidence and destructive power. The Northeast
   Region, the second national producing region, apparently presents the
   best conditions for the citrus industry expansion. Among potential
   areas, the Sao Francisco Valley appears as one the best options due to
   the semiarid climate, governmental support and tradition in the
   irrigated fruit production and export. The region, with 360,000 ha
   potentially irrigable, is located between 8 and 9 degrees S and 40 and
   42 degrees W and altitude of 300 m a.s.l. The annual rainfall is less
   than 600 mm and the average temperature is 26.2 degrees C, relative
   humidity of 67\% and solar radiation of 3,000 h/year, constituting a
   comparative advantage to species such as acid lime, lemon and
   grapefruit. Citrus scions and rootstocks trials have been carried out
   since the 1990s by Embrapa in cooperation with the private sector in the
   States of Bahia and Pernambuco, which results are presented in this
   paper, showing the potentiality of the Sao Francisco Valley as a new
   belt for the Brazilian citrus industry.},

Abstract = {The citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) has become endemic in Florida,
   with estimates that greater than 80\% of citrus trees are currently
   infected. Although there are no commercial citrus varieties with strong
   HLB resistance, some field tolerance has been observed in trees exposed
   to the disease after they were mature. There is great urgency to
   identify citrus which may permit economic citrus production where HLB is
   endemic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess field
   tolerance to HLB. To expedite the trial due to urgency, nursery trees
   were purchased on rootstock varieties as available. The trial included
   the following unbalanced scion/rootstock combinations: `Hamlin/Kinkoji',
   `Hamlin/Cleopatra', `Temple/Cleopatra', `Fallglo/Kinkoji', `Sugar
   Belle/Sour Orange', `Tango/Kuharske', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji', with most
   comparisons based solely on scion/rootstock combinations. A randomized
   complete block experiment was established at Fort Pierce, FL, in Sept.
   2010. All trees exhibited symptoms of HLB and tested positive for the
   Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) bacterium by Oct. 2012, with
   similar titers {[}directly assessed as cycle threshold (Ct) using
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)] measured for all
   scion/rootstocks at most sample dates, but early titer development in
   `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' was significantly lower than several other
   scion/rootstocks. Across all time-points, `Fallglo/Kinkoji' had the
   lowest rating of distinctive HLB mottling and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' had the
   highest rating, but `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' had the highest percentage
   of leaves affected. After 5 years, `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' and
   `Tango/Kuharske' had the greatest overall increase in trunk diameter,
   and were among the healthiest in overall appearance. In Oct. 2015,
   `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' and `Tango/Kuharske' trees had significantly
   greater fruit load (80-88 fruit/tree) followed by `Temple/Cleopatra' and
   `Fallglo/Kinkoji' (31-35 fruit/tree) while `Hamlin/Kinkoji',
   `Hamlin/Cleopatra', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' produced less than 20 fruit
   per tree. Despite becoming infected by CLas in less than 2 years after
   planting, the trees continued to grow and all scion/rootstocks displayed
   increasing fruit production, although very low in `Hamlin/Kinkoji',
   `Hamlin/Cleopatra', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji'. Growth and fruit production
   in the highest performing scion/rootstocks were likely less than would
   be expected for healthy trees, but these results are promising, with
   markedly better response of some scion/rootstocks with mandarin hybrid
   scions compared with trees with sweet orange or grapefruit scions.
   Larger fully replicated trials are underway. It is noteworthy that the
   most pronounced HLB symptoms and higher early pathogen titer, which are
   the two criteria most widely used in assessing HLB resistance, were not
   associated with the lowest growth and cropping, and focus on early
   symptomatic traits when screening for resistance may obscure important
   disease tolerance.},

Volume = {181},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to examine the compatibility of different
   rootstocks with various wine grape varieties. In the first trial, Vitis
   vinifera L cvs. Furmint, Regent, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, and
   Welschriesling were grafted onto Borner, 5BB and SO4 rootstocks. In the
   second trial Welschriesling was grafted on 12 rootstocks. Their growth
   during the first year in the vineyard was measured. As an index of
   compatibility, the percentage of first grade grafted vines as well as
   dry weight of mature shoots (canes) and roots was determined. After the
   grafts went through the first phase of healing often called callusing
   (2-3 weeks of moist warm conditions), the differences in callus
   formation were greater between years than among rootstocks, which were
   the most obvious with Furmint as a scion. No good callus formation
   occurred when cane (rootstock, scion) maturity is not adequate. Such was
   the case in 2005, there were 24\% fewer grafts with fully developed
   callus than those in 2006. The dry weight of roots was higher on 5BB
   than on Borner and SO4. Borner rootstock had fewer roots, and the roots
   were thinner. Welschriesling had good compatibility with all rootstocks
   (the average grafts success was 67\%), but that of 5BB, G251, and G103
   (above 80\%),was greater than the average. The G103 rootstock had the
   highest dry weight of roots. Shoot growth in vineyards was above the
   average with 5BB, SO4, Binova, Rimer, and MV rootstocks. All Georgikon
   rootstocks had a lower cane dry weight per vine than the others. (C)

Abstract = {Grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) feeds exclusively on Vitis
   species, preferentially on leaves of American Vitis species and roots of
   European Vitis vinifera. Over the last 15 years, extensive feeding and
   galling on V. vinifera leaves have been observed in Italy, Brazil, and
   Peru. In Uruguay, D. vitifoliae infestations on V. vinifera leaves were
   detected in very high densities. The cause of this unexpected insect
   behavior is unknown, but possible explanations include selection
   pressure for more aggressive native strains in the new context of
   vigorous plants replacing old vineyards, loss of resistance in plants
   due to improvement programs, or importation of exotic strains of the
   insect. The aims of this research were to evaluate genetic diversity of
   leaf-galling populations of Uruguayan phylloxera, to estimate genetic
   distances among them, and to compare Uruguayan and foreign phylloxera
   populations (Brazilian, Peruvian, and European). Genetic distances
   between root and leaf samples from the same plant were also estimated.
   Four polymorphic microsatellite primers were used in this study. In the
   analysis of leaf- and root-insect populations from the same plant,
   different insect genotypes were found on grafted vines, with one
   genotype on the rootstock and one on the V. vinifera (cultivar scion).
   For Uruguayan leaf-galling insect populations, the average number of
   alleles per locus was 4.25. Genetic variance found among individuals
   within populations was 88\% (SE = 2.298, p < 0.001), and 12\% between
   populations (SE = 0.319, p < 0.001). An F-ST of 0.211 (p < 0.001)
   suggests limited genetic flow among populations. Significant deviation
   from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium detected for the loci analyzed and the
   negative F-IS values together suggest that parthenogenesis could be the
   reproductive mode. Genetic diversity found in this work shows
   considerable potential for host adaptation to environmental variability.},

Abstract = {Past studies have shown that the major source of infection of young
   grapevine plants by Botryosphaeriaceae fungi were through the use of
   infected rootstock and scion cuttings. To investigate the potential
   infection pathways of Botryosphaeriaceae species within a rootstock
   mother vine, three genotyping studies using universally-primed
   polymerase chain reaction (UP-PCR) were conducted with two Neofusicoccum
   species, namely N. luteum and N. parvum. The investigations identified
   genotypes of the fungal isolates in trunk and shoot infections of the
   same mother vine. Results showed that the trunk and shoot isolates from
   the same vine were of the same or different genotypes, suggesting
   multiple infections from different inoculum sources. This study further
   showed that the Neofusicoccum isolates recovered from the surfaces of
   the cuttings were of the same or different genotypes from those isolated
   from adjacent internal tissues, again suggesting multiple sources of
   external inoculum. Investigations into the spatial distribution of
   Botryosphaeriaceae fungi within an entire dormant cane also showed that
   multiple species and genotypes were distributed along the cane but most
   isolates were sited within the bark, being less frequently in the wood,
   which suggested that they were latent on surface tissues. Since some
   adjacent wood and bark infections were caused by the same genotypes,
   this indicated that wood infection may have originated from the bark.
   These fungi appear to cause latent infections in the bark of dormant
   cuttings which are used in plant propagation, thus providing an
   additional infection pathway for a disease that is known to show obvious
   symptoms only in older vineyards.},

Abstract = {The salt tolerance of rootstocks is often assessed based on their
   ability to limit uptake of sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) ions. Here, we
   evaluated the effects of three irrigation salinity levels (electrical
   conductivity of 1.2, 2.7, and 4.2 dS/m) on Cabernet Sauvignon grapes
   grafted on Ruggeri, Paulsen, 216/3, and 101/14 rootstocks. Growth
   parameters were affected by salinity level but not by rootstock, and
   yield was not affected by either variable. Ruggeri and 216/3 were most
   effective at limiting uptake and accumulation of Na and Cl in scion
   petioles, wood, and must. The rootstocks differentially excluded Na and
   Cl from vines; 216/3 and Ruggeri showed the best performance for Na and
   Cl, respectively. More Na than Cl accumulated in woody tissue. Mortality
   rates as high as 17.5\% were found for poor salt-excluding rootstocks
   irrigated with the highest salinity water. The apparent breakdown of
   tolerance mechanisms, leading to salt damage and vine mortality, might
   be due to Na reaching critical levels in woody tissues. The ability to
   exclude Na and Cl from shoots and fruit was found to (a) increase wine
   quality by reducing concentrations of salt ions in must and wine, and
   (b) reduce mortality rates that result from long-term exposure to salt.},

Title = {Water limitation and rootstock genotype interact to alter grape berry
   metabolism through transcriptome reprogramming},
Journal = {HORTICULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Grapevine is a perennial crop often cultivated by grafting a scion
   cultivar on a suitable rootstock. Rootstocks influence scions,
   particularly with regard to water uptake and vigor. Therefore, one of
   the possibilities to adapt viticulture to the extended drought stress
   periods is to select rootstocks conferring increased tolerance to
   drought. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with the ability
   of rootstock/scion combination to influence grape berry metabolism under
   drought stress are still poorly understood. The transcriptomic changes
   induced by drought stress in grape berries (cv. Pinot noir) from vines
   grafted on either 110R (drought-tolerant) or 125AA (drought-sensitive)
   rootstock were compared. The experiments were conducted in the vineyard
   for two years and two grape berry developmental stages (50\% and 100\%
   veraison). The genome-wide microarray approach showed that water stress
   strongly impacts gene expression in the berries, through ontology
   categories that cover cell wall metabolism, primary and secondary
   metabolism, signaling, stress, and hormones, and that some of these
   effects strongly depend on the rootstock genotype. Indeed, under drought
   stress, berries from vines grafted on 110R displayed a different
   transcriptional response compared to 125AA-concerning genes related to
   jasmonate (JA), phenylpropanoid metabolism, and pathogenesis-related
   proteins. The data also suggest a link between JA and secondary
   metabolism in water-stressed berries. Overall, genes related to
   secondary metabolism and JA are more induced and/or less repressed by
   drought stress in the berries grafted on the drought-sensitive rootstock
   125AA. These rootstock-dependent gene expression changes are relevant
   for berry composition and sensory properties.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {`Marsh Seedless' and `Redblush' cultivars of grapefruit (Citrus paradisi
   Macf.) were budded on nine different rootstocks under the typical
   sub-tropical growing conditions of North India. Significant variations
   in tree physiology were observed due to rootstock effects. Trees of both
   scions had the highest photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance
   (g(s)) on `Rough Lemon' rootstock. Rates of transpiration (E) in `Marsh
   Seedless' were higher on `Sour Orange', `Rough Lemon', `KarnaKhatta',
   `Billikhichli', `RLC-4', `Troyer Citrange', `Jatti Khatti', or
   `Attani-2' rootstocks than on `Attani-1'. In `Redblush', values of E
   were significantly higher on `Troyer Citrange', `Attani-2', `Jatti
   Khatti', `Billikhichli', `Sour Orange', and `Karna Khatta' than on
   `Attani-1' or `RLC-4'. In `Marsh Seedless', higher relative water
   content (RWC) values and lower excised leaf water loss (ELWL) values
   were observed on the rootstocks `Billikhichli' and `RLC-4', but the RWC
   was highest in `Redblush' on `Rough Lemon' rootstock, and the lowest
   ELWL value was recorded on `Troyer Citrange'. `Redblush' had the highest
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione reductase
   (GR) activities on `Attani-2' rootstock, whereas catalase (CAT) was most
   active in the leaves of `Redblush' trees budded on `RLC-4'. The highest
   activities of CAT and GR in `Marsh Seedless' were on `Billikhichli,
   whereas SOD and POD activities were highest in the leaves of `Marsh
   Seedless' on `Rough Lemon' and on `Attani-2' rootstocks, respectively.
   `Marsh Seedless' on `Troyer' or `Karna Khatta', and `Redblush' on
   `Billikhichli' or `Rough Lemon', had the highest total soluble protein
   concentrations in their leaves. Overall, differential responses to
   rootstock were observed in both grapefruit scion cultivars. `Rough
   Lemon' was the best rootstock to induce high metabolic activity in both
   scion cultivars under normal growing conditions. However, high RWC
   values and antioxidant enzyme activities in `Marsh Seedless' on
   `Billikhichli' and in `Redblush' on `Troyer Citrange', `Attani-2', or
   `RLC-4', indicated their utility as rootstocks under stressful growing
   conditions.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {311-318},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background and AimsBoth rootstocks and mineral nutrition, particularly
   nitrogen (N), are known to affect many aspects of plant development
   including the control of scion vigour. In this study, we investigated
   the role of the rootstock genotype in grafted grapevine responses to N
   supply in terms of the root and leaf ionomes, scion vigour and whole
   plant biomass.
   Methods and ResultsVitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon was grafted on
   two rootstock genotypes known to confer high and low vigour. Plants were
   grown for 60 days under three levels of nitrate supply. Stem, leaf,
   trunk and root biomass, and the concentration of 13 macroelements and
   microelements in roots and leaves were measured. High scion vigour was
   associated with a high concentration of elements in the leaves. The
   concentration of some elements in the leaves, such as phosphorus, was
   affected by the N supply differently in the two scion/rootstock
   combinations.
   ConclusionDifferences in rootstock conferred vigour were associated with
   particular shoot and root ionome profiles, and these responses were
   dependent on N supply.
   Significance of the StudyThese results demonstrate that rootstocks alter
   scion growth and the leaf ionome in response to N supply.},

Title = {Induction of nitrate uptake in Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay grapevines
   depends on the scion and is affected by the rootstock},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {331-338},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background and AimsNitrate is a major form of inorganic nitrogen present
   in cultivated soils; however, information on the mechanisms responsible
   for uptake of the anion in grapevines is scarce.
   Methods and ResultsThe response to external nitrate was studied in two
   clones of the cultivars Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Grapevines,
   own-rooted or grafted on the two rootstocks SO4 and K5BB, were grown in
   nutrient solution and, after a period of nitrogen (N)-deprivation,
   exposed to 0.2 or 1mmol/L nitrate. The uptake was an inducible process,
   operated by high- and low-affinity transport systems. The magnitude and
   time dependence of the induction varied as a function of the clone.
   Uptake rate as a function of nitrate external concentration showed a
   multiphasic pattern. Although nitrate exposure caused a transient
   up-regulation of nitrate influx transporter genes, a clear correlation
   with the rise in nitrate uptake could not be found; in contrast, a
   negative relationship between changes in uptake rates and expression of
   a nitrate efflux transporter gene was observed.
   ConclusionsIn the grapevine, the response of low- and high-affinity
   transport systems to external nitrate was favoured by the presence of
   the rootstock and also dependent on the characteristics of the scion.
   Low-affinity uptake and efflux from root cells conceivably play an
   important role in the overall N-nitrate acquisition.
   Significance of the StudyThis study shows that activation of mechanisms
   involved in nitrate uptake in the grapevine is strongly affected by the
   scion-rootstock combination. Results may be significant for developing
   agronomic practices and selection programmes related to nitrogen use in
   the grapevine.},

   Fruit quality was assessed by mass loss and peel color, the percentage

   over the course of storage followed similar patterns for both cultivars,
   regardless of rootstock. The influence of scion-rootstock combination on
   the studied variables was dependent on the time of harvest. The peel
   color of `Ruby Red' grafted on `Swingle' citrumelo is more vivid and
   redder when harvested in October than when harvested in August. `Ruby
   Red' and `Star Ruby' grapefruit harvested in October are sweeter, less
   acidic, juicier, and richer in ascorbic acid than those harvested in
   August. `Cleopatra' mandarin rootstock might favor ascorbic acid levels
   at harvest, but the fruit may lose more weight during storage.},

Abstract = {Anthracnose is a severe disease present in several grape production

   plots were represented by 9 different combinations. Disease incidence
   was assessed at two week-interval from September to March (2010/2011,
   2011/2012, and 2012/2013). At each sampling, disease was assessed 10
   leaves of a same shoot of 6 plants for each cultivar/rootstock

   combinations showed disease symptoms with highest disease incidence
   coinciding with the greatest amount of precipitation. Based on the
   relative area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), the anthracnose
   incidence showed differences between seasons. Differences between
   rootstocks and rootstock/cultivar combinations were observed during the
   first and third season, but there was no consistency between the
   seasons, indicating that the variation in disease progress could be due
   to other factors, including as weather conditions, age of the vineyard

   Excess of heterozygotes and significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg

Abstract = {Pecan {[}Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch], a hardwood tree native
   to North America, is grown for commercial production of nuts in
   southeastern, central, and western regions of the United States. Pecan
   is also grown commercially in Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and some
   countries in South America. Pecan trees can be infected by the broad
   host range xylem-limited bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa Wells et
   al. Infection incites a leaf scorch disease that can cause significant
   defoliation, reduced tree growth, and lower nut yield. Pecan cultivars
   are clonally propagated onto rootstocks grown from open-pollinated seed
   of selected cultivars. X. fastidiosa is transmitted at a high frequency
   from infected rootstocks into newly developing grafted trees. Rootstocks
   resistant to infection would be beneficial to pecan nurseries and pecan
   producers to prevent infection of young trees through grafting,
   especially when combined with hot-water treatment of scions to eliminate
   the pathogen. Some common rootstocks were tested for variation in
   susceptibility to infection using mechanical inoculation with the
   pathogen. No outstanding level of resistance to infection was detected
   among the seven rootstocks tested. The rootstocks from `Curtis',
   `Elliott', and `Riverside' were less susceptible than one standard
   rootstock in the test ('VC1-68') and less susceptible than highly
   susceptible `Cape Fear' rootstock. Conversely, the rootstocks from
   `Apache', `Moore', `Stuart', and `VC1-68' seed had a level of
   susceptibility to infection comparable to `Cape Fear' and perhaps are
   not the best choice for rootstocks in geographic areas where X.
   fastidiosa is prevalent. The results of this research suggest that there
   is variation in rootstock susceptibility to infection by X fastidiosa.
   The use of mechanical inoculation may facilitate identification of
   susceptibility categories of pecan rootstocks to the pecan bacterial
   leaf scorch pathogen.},

Abstract = {Objectives of this study were to quantify starch and soluble sugar
   concentrations in wine grape (Vitis sp.) scionwood and rootstock
   material, and to examine relationships between carbohydrate (CHO)
   metrics and both grafting success and shoot growth. CHOs of three wine
   grape scionwood cultivars {[}Merlot and Riesling (Vitis vinifera) and
   Vidal blanc (Vitis sp.)] harvested from four separate vineyards in the
   Niagara Peninsula in Ontario were analyzed for starch, total CHOs, total
   sugars, sucrose, monosaccharides (glucose, fructose), and
   oligosaccharides (raffinose, stachyose) to determine if CHO differences
   existed between scionwood cultivar and site, and whether these impacted
   propagation success when grafted to two different rootstocks {[}'3309
   Couderc' (3309) and `101-14 Millardet et de Grasset' (101-14) (V.
   riparia x V. rupestris)]. Differences in CHOs existed between vineyards
   for all cuhivars, and their relationship with propagation success was
   most evident with `Vidal blanc'. Differences were also observed between
   sites for some cultivars in terms of grafting success and shoot length
   of grafted vines. Hot water treatment (HWT) of rootstock increased total
   sugars, glucose, fructose, and stachyose in 3309, and led to lower
   starch, total CHOs, and higher sucrose in 101-14 when measured
   immediately following HWT. At time of grafting, HWT 3309 had lower
   starch sucrose and raffmose, and higher glucose, fructose, and total
   sugars compared with non-HWT material, whereas HWT 101-14 contained
   lower total sugars, raffinose, and sucrose and higher stachyose and
   glucose. Stachyose, raffmose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and total
   sugars in scionwood at time of grafting were correlated with propagation
   success. However, CHOs at time of scionwood collection in February did
   not correlate to successful propagation. Relationships between scion
   viability of all cultivars vs. stachyose and total sugars for both
   rootstocks suggested a possible relationship between these CHO metrics
   and propagation success. Differences likewise existed between
   propagation success on rootstocks 3309 and 101-14 on most occasions with
   3309 displaying higher percent scion viability and shoot growth. This
   may be of particular importance in grafting difficult-to-propagate
   rootstock cultivars.},

Abstract = {Drought resistance in a grapevine rootstock was associated with root
   traits that maintain higher water uptake capacity via less suberization
   so roots can resupply the shoot with water upon rewatering.Water
   deficits are known to alter fine root structure and function, but little
   is known about how these responses contribute to differences in drought
   resistance across grapevine rootstocks. The ways in which water deficit
   affects root anatomical and physiological characteristics were studied
   in two grapevine rootstocks considered as low-medium (101-14Mgt) and
   highly (110R) drought resistant. Rootstocks were grown under prolonged
   and repeated drying cycles or frequent watering ('dry' and `wet'
   treatments, respectively), and the following parameters were evaluated:
   root osmotic and hydrostatic hydraulic conductivity (Lp (os) and Lp
   (hyd), respectively), suberization, steady-state root pressure (P (rs)),
   sap exudation rates, sap osmotic potential, and exosmotic relaxation
   curves. For both rootstocks, the `dry' treatment reduced fine root Lp,
   elicited earlier root suberization and higher sap osmotic potential, and
   generated greater P (rs) after rewatering, but the rootstocks responded
   differently under these conditions. Lp (os), Lp (hyd), and sap exudation
   rates were significantly higher in 110R than in 101-14Mgt, regardless of
   moisture treatment. Under `dry' conditions, 110R maintained a similar Lp
   (os) and decreased the Lp (hyd) by 36\% compared with `wet' conditions,
   while both parameters were decreased by at least 50\% for 101-14Mgt
   under `dry' conditions. Interestingly, build-up of P (rs) in 110R was
   34\% lower on average than in 101-14Mgt, suggesting differences in the
   development of suberized apoplastic barriers between the rootstocks as
   visualized by analysis of suberization from fluorescence microscopy.
   Consistent with this pattern, 110R exhibited the greatest exosmotic Lp
   (os) (i.e. Lp (os) of water flowing from roots to the soil) as
   determined from relaxation curves under wet conditions, where backflow
   may have limited its capacity to generate positive xylem pressure. The
   traits studied here can be used in combination to provide new insights
   needed for screening drought resistance across grapevine rootstocks.},

Title = {Messenger RNA exchange between scions and rootstocks in grafted
   grapevines},
Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Background: Grafting has been widely practiced for centuries in the
   propagation and production of many vegetable and fruit species. However,
   the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms for how the graft
   partners interact with each other to produce a successful graft remain
   largely unknown. We hypothesized that genome-wide mRNA exchanges, which
   were recently documented in grafted model plant species, are a general
   phenomenon widely present in grafted plants, including those in
   vegetable and fruit species, and have specific genotype-and
   environment-dependent characteristics modulating plant performance.
   Methods: Using diagnostic SNPs derived from high throughput genome
   sequencing, we identified and characterized the patterns of genome-wide
   mRNA exchanges across graft junctions in grafted grapevines grown in the
   in vitro and field conditions.
   Results: We identified more than 3000 genes transporting mRNAs across
   graft junctions. These genes were involved in diverse biological
   processes and those involved in basic cellular, biosynthetic, catabolic,
   and metabolic activities, as well as responses to stress and signal
   transduction, were highly enriched. Field-grown mature grafts had much
   fewer genes transmitting mRNAs than the in vitro young grafts (987 vs.
   2679). These mobile mRNAs could move directionally or bi-directionally
   between scions and rootstocks. The mRNA transmission rates of these
   genes were generally low, with 65 \% or more having transmission rates
   lower than 0.01. Furthermore, genotypes, graft combinations and growth
   environments had impact on the directions of mRNA movement as well as
   the numbers and species of mRNAs being exchanged. Moreover, we found
   evidence for the presences of both passive and selective mechanisms
   underlying long distance mRNA trafficking in grafted grapevines.
   Conclusions: We extended the studies of mRNA exchanges in model species
   to grapevines and demonstrated that genomic-scale mRNA exchange across
   graft junctions occurred in grapevines in a passive or genotype and
   environment-dependent manner.},

Abstract = {A Mature Citrus Facility (MCF) was established at the University of
   Florida's Citrus Research and Education Center (CREC) to produce
   transgenic citrus (Citrus spp.) tolerant to canker and greening
   bacterial diseases. Plants produced from mature tissue should flower and
   fruit early. Budsticks of `Hamlin', `Valencia', and `Pineapple' sweet
   orange {[}C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck] and `Ray Ruby' grapefruit (C.
   paradisi Macfad.) were obtained from the Florida Division of Plant
   Industry (DPI) and introduced into the facility through shoot-tip
   grafting (STG). These plants were tested for bacteria, phloem-limited
   Huanglongbing (HLB), and indexed for viruses to ensure freedom from
   disease. Mature buds were grafted onto immature rootstock and the first
   two flushes of mature scion used in transformation feasibility studies
   with Agrobacterium strain EHA105 harboring pCAM-BIA2301 and strain
   EHA101 harboring pTLAB21, which carry the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and
   green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters, respectively.
   beta-glucuronidase assays or GFP fluorescence was used to identify
   transgenic shoots, which developed through organogenesis from stem
   explants. Transgenic shoots were micrografted onto immature rootstock,
   and secondarily micrografted onto 4- to 5-mo-old rootstock. NPTII enzyme
   expression in older trees was confirmed using the immunostrip and
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Southern blots of a
   representative group of transgenics showed that most were low copy
   number with 1 to 3 copies of the T-DNA integrated into the genome. There
   were a large number of escapes on kanamycin, and many transgenic shoots
   were lost in micrografting. Several transgenic trees flowered 18 to 19
   mo after cocultivation with Agrobacterium. Transformation of mature
   citrus with disease resistance genes would be a feasible way to produce
   citrus tolerant to canker and greening.},

Abstract = {The influence of dwarfing persimmon rootstock choice on tree growth,
   labor requirements, and fruit quality of Japanese persimmon cultivar
   (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) was evaluated in a field experiment. We compared
   the growth of `Fuyu' scions grafted onto three candidate dwarfing
   rootstocks (SH11, No. 3, and S22) with that on `Aogaki', a standard
   seedling rootstock, in the field. Six years after planting, the canopy
   volume on the three dwarfing rootstocks was about 44-54\% of that on the
   standard rootstock. Similarly, the trunk cross-sectional area of the
   scions on the dwarfing rootstocks was about 37-60\% of that on `Aogaki'.
   The total labor time required for the trees on the dwarfing rootstocks
   was about 1/4-1/2 less than that on `Aogaki'. The fruits produced on S22
   and No. 3 rootstocks had lower soluble solids than those on `Aogaki',
   but those produced on SH11 showed no significant differences in fruit
   quality (fruit weight, soluble solids, and peel color) from those on
   `Aogaki'. Trees on S22 produced the lowest yield owing to decreased
   vigor. Even though trees on `Aogaki' produced the highest yield, those
   on SH11 had the highest yield efficiency. These results identify SH11 as
   a promising new rootstock for growing dwarfed `Fuyu' trees because of
   the scions' high yield efficiency and reduced labor requirements.},

   particularly the timing of budbreak and canopy vigour, yield components
   and fruit composition at harvest. The selection of rootstock/scion
   combinations that best suit the nuances of the environment will assist
   the grower in achieving production goals. In 1991 a trial was planted to

   Measurements of vine development over a 16-year period showed that
   rootstock affected early shoot growth, canopy vigour and yield of
   `Sauvignon Blanc'. For younger vines, seasonal effects on yield per bud
   across rootstocks dominated rootstock effects, and as vines matured,
   yield differences among rootstocks became more apparent. Rootstocks also
   influenced berry size and juice composition at harvest, specifically
   soluble solids content and pH. Schwarzmann had the highest berry weight
   and the lowest soluble solids content of all the rootstocks. In the
   final seven years of the study, 3309 Couderc had the highest juice pH of
   all the rootstocks. Trends in the performance of scions on different
   rootstocks only became apparent over time, highlighting the importance
   of evaluating mature vines.},

Abstract = {Young vine decline, caused by the ground pearl or margarodes
   (Eurhizococcus brasiliensis) and pathogenic fungi (Cylindrocarpon,
   Phaeoacremonium and others), is a major problem in many vineyards of
   Southern Brazil. According to previous studies, the most resistant
   roostocks were hybrids of tropical species, such as Vitis caribaea (IAC
   572, IAC 571-6, IAC 766) and V. cinerea ( IAC 313). A medium resistance
   level was observed in V. champinii (Dog Ridge) and Muscadinia
   rotundifolia hybrids (VR 043-43). However, these rootstocks have not
   being used in grape growing areas of Southern Brazil. An experiment was
   carried out to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of the scion
   cultivar Moscato Embrapa grafted on these rootstocks compared to Paulsen
   1103 and R99, considered standards for this region. The tropical
   rootstocks IAC 313, IAC571-6, and IAC 766 induced earlier bud break
   compared to Paulsen 1103, the opposite of VR043-43 and Dog Ridge. In
   general aspects, all rootstocks tested can be used for grape production.
   Even the tropical rootstocks with no winter dormancy behave as normal
   rootstocks when grafted. IAC 572 has an advantage of not inducing early
   bud break. However, excessive vigor is the most limiting factor for IAC
   572, requiring especial management practices to control vegetative
   development.},

Abstract = {The scion-rootstock interaction may influence several physiological
   issues such as water relations, leaf gas exchange, mineral uptake, etc.
   Moreover, performance of different rootstock types could be variable
   under different environmental conditions, thus the appropriate rootstock
   selection has great importance for the producers. In this study three
   different types of rootstocks were tested in loess soil. The research
   was carried out in the Tokaj wine region, where the loess is one of the
   most important parent material types. Ruggeri 140, 5C and Fercal
   rootstock varieties were involved in the experiment with `Furmint'
   scions. Our hypothesis was that the scion would show better vegetative
   growth on better rootstock type thus the rootstock quality was measured
   as the cumulative length of the shoots. Altogether 726 vines were
   measured and analysed by Generalized Linear Models and GIS methods. The
   vegetative growth of the shoots is significantly influenced by the
   rootstock type, but also the surveyed soil variables. Significant
   relationship between shoot length and the geographic location of the
   stock was also indicated. Despite this, the effect of rootstock type on
   shoot growth remained significant even if we used geographic coordinates
   as random factor. Our results showed that the shoot growth was slightly
   better in Fercal than Ruggeri 140 or 5C in loess soil This rootstock
   type was the less affected by the soil variables providing better
   vegetative growth in all conditions than 5C and Ruggeri 140. The Fercal
   has been already widely used rootstock type in Tokaj region, however,
   not only in loess soils.},

Abstract = {Seedless table grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) are generally grafted onto
   vigorous rootstocks and always grown with irrigation in arid climate
   regions, characterized by low rainfall and high evaporative demand such
   as it occurs in Apulia region. Rootstock may affect vegetative growth,
   cluster composition and scion water use. Research was conducted in
   Apulia region, southern Italy, to determine the impact of five
   rootstocks (161.49 C., 34 E.M., 1103 Paulsen, 140 Ruggeri and 41 B) on
   field performance of `Princess' table grape and to verify possible
   scion-rootstock affinity problems. `Princess' vines have exhibited a
   good performance on all five rootstocks. Onto 1103 Paulsen, `Princess'
   vines have shown the highest berry weight while the highest total
   soluble solid was reached onto 161.49 C. and 140 Ruggeri. The highest
   pruning weight and the lowest crop yield/pruning weight were produced by
   vines grafted onto 41 B. According to our data, rootstocks also affect
   yield per vine, skin color coordinates and berry firmness.},

Abstract = {Vine rootstocks are known to have an influence on the vegetative growth
   and yield of the scion, and also can influence fruit quality in grafted
   vines with direct effects on the uptake of water and mineral elements,
   or more indirectly by affecting the balance between fruit and shoot
   growth. The adaptability of rootstocks to restrictive soil conditions,
   water and nutrient supply is variable. The impact of different
   rootstocks on vine performance and scion could be useful information for
   selecting which rootstock is more suitable for the soils with reduced
   water availability. This study was conducted in 2013 on three Vitis
   vinifera L. cultivars ('Summer Royal', `Crimson seedless' and `Autumn
   Royal') grown in Apulia region (southern Italy) and planted in the same
   trial site. All vines were grafted onto two rootstocks ('140 Ru' and `34
   EM') and subjected to two different irrigation practices under
   controlled water deficit, in order to study the effect of grafting and
   water deficit on the whole vine growth and productive development. In
   particular, vine performance was assessed throughout the season by
   determining the leaf water potential and, at harvest, the crop yield and
   both the organoleptic and nutritional (organic acids, carbohydrates,
   flavonoid and non-flavonoid phenolic compounds) grape quality. From the
   preliminary findings, we can conclude that physiological responses, such
   as water relations, of table grape vines could be influenced by the
   rootstock type, whilst metabolomic characterization of mature grapes
   suggest that the fruit quality was mainly dependent on the cultivar
   genotype, even though the different size-controlling rootstocks exerted
   a relevant influence, especially on vines under restricted water regime.},

Abstract = {Several North American Vitis species are used to breed scions and
   rootstocks, including V riparia and V rupestris. However, the degree to
   which Vitis species can be distinguished using remote sensing is not
   well known. Here we explore whether two North American Vitis species and
   genotypes growing in a common garden can be discriminated with leaf and
   canopy hyperspectral reflectance factor data (350-2500 nm) using
   independent t-test and derivative analysis. Foliar properties and
   spectral indices of the grapevines were evaluated with analysis of the
   variance (ANOVA) and pair-wise Bonferroni adjusted t-tests. The results
   showed that V riparia and V rupestris can be distinguished at the leaf
   level spectra of visible, near-and infrared spectral regions. At the
   canopy level, genotypes were spectrally discriminated with limited
   success. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) demonstrated the
   highest potential not only to differentiate two species, but also two
   genotype pair groups within V rupestris. This finding was also true for
   the PRI calculated with simulated EO-1 Hyperion data. These capacities
   to distinguish Vitis species, and to a lesser extent genotypes, using
   spectral signatures have important applications in remote monitoring of
   vineyards for plants health and also for locating wild Vitis populations
   for future crop improvement efforts.},

Abstract = {The interaction between rootstock and scion can influence the vegetative
   and productive balance of grapevines. Vascular connections and patterns
   may be related to the observed phenotype of certain rootstock-scion
   combinations. However, little is known about the physiology of the
   rootstock-scion interaction and the related anatomical variables. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the rootstock-scion
   interaction on the vegetative growth of Vitis vinifera L., with a focus
   on the vascular system. We investigated the rootstock genotypes 1103
   Paulsen (Vitis berlandieri Planch. x Vitis rupestris Scheele), 101-14
   Mgt (Vitis riparia Michx. x V. rupestris), and SO4 (V. berlandieri x V.
   riparia) grafted on the Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapevine
   varieties. We evaluated vegetative growth variables and performed an
   image analysis of the vascular system by quantifying the xylem and
   vessels (diameter, total number, density, and frequency) in different
   portions (apical, median, and basal) of the scion stem. The
   rootstock-scion interaction caused differences in vegetative growth and
   was associated with differences in the vascular system. The vegetative
   growth of the Cabernet Sauvignon on 1103 Paulsen and Merlot on SO4
   combinations was greater than the growths of either variety grafted on
   101-14 Mgt. The more vigorous rootstock-scion combinations had vessels
   with greater mean diameters, xylem areas, and proportion of vessels with
   diameters greater than 50 mu m. Vines grafted on 101-14 Mgt had a
   greater proportion of vessels with diameters less than 40 m. The vessel
   features were altered from the apex to base sections (stem morphology)
   in all combinations. The physiological interaction between
   rootstock-scion modified the vascular system in grapevines by altering
   the xylem vessel.},

   provide important chloride exclusion properties to the scion. Several
   approaches to grow Vitis vinifera plants more stress-tolerant may
   include the improvement of cultural practices, the selection of more
   tolerant cultivars and the production of Vitis hybrids. Increasing
   knowledge of the metabolic rearrangements involved in the response to an
   environmental stress such as high soil salinity, but also to drought or
   heat, could open the possibility of better adapted vineyard management
   (exogenous compounds, canopy control, etc.) without necessarily turning

Abstract = {Grapevines were propagated from cuttings up until the late 19th century
   when the soil-borne aphid phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae
   {[}Fitch]) destroyed Vitis vinifera L. vines grown on their own roots.
   The damaging import of grape phylloxera to France in 1868 led to
   extensive international research and collaboration to save European
   viticulture. Numerous growers, breeders and scientists played important
   roles in the historic campaign against the grape phylloxera and in
   finding the solution to this problem, which ultimately lay in grafting
   European vines on American rootstocks. Nowadays, more than 80\% of the
   vineyards worldwide use grafted plants: a scion of V. vinifera grafted
   onto a rootstock of single American Vitis species or interspecific
   hybrids of Vitis species that combine desirable features of their
   parentage. The majority of rootstocks used today were bred at the end of
   the 19th century or at the turn of the 20th century. They are mainly
   hybrids of four species: V. berlandieri, V. riparia, V. rupestris and V.
   vinifera, but secondary species have also been used. In addition to
   phylloxera, rootstocks contribute to the control of other soilborne
   pests such as nematodes and to various abiotic constraints such as
   drought, salinity, limestone and mineral nutrition problems. They also
   strongly interact with scion genotypes and modify whole plant
   development, biomass accumulation and repartition, and phenology. In the
   context of climate change, they may be considered as a key element of
   adaptation. Rootstock breeding programs in the main grape growing
   countries around the world aim to improve pest resistance and adaptation
   to abiotic stresses. This article will give an overview of the history
   of rootstock use in the world, a brief description of the main
   rootstocks cultivated and some details on current breeding programs.},

Abstract = {Grapevine root system structure and development is dependent on both
   environmental and genetic factors like most of the woody perennial
   plants. Vineyard established with grafts has two genetic factors the
   rootstock and scion. In our study the effect of the rootstock-scion
   interactions on root system development were examined with two methods,
   with soil wall profile and with minirhizotron root monitoring system.
   Number of roots was counted on soil wall profile according to their size
   and soil depth for 6 rootstocks (Teleki 5C, Teleki 8B, TK 5BB, Ruggeri
   140, Fercal and Georgikon 28) and 3 scion cultivars ('Italian Riesling',
   `Vinitor', `Pelso'). The vineyard was established in 1992, data were
   collected 18 years later. A second experiment was set it up in 2013 with
   9-year-old `Cabernet Sauvignon' plantation established on 5 rootstocks
   (Teleki 5C, TK 5BB, TF SO4, Fercal, Georgikon 28). Root development was
   recorded by a minirhizotron camera system at two weeks interval. Data
   were analyzed by RootSnap softwer. The number and size of roots differed
   according to the rootstock-scion combinations. Ratio of fine to larger
   roots (< 2 mm/>2 mm) varied between 0.55 and 6.5, what is suggested
   ineffective to very effective root system of the combinations,
   respectively. It was observed that root growth has started later than
   bud break in 2013. Previous findings, that early shoot development
   ``financed{''} from the reserves of woody part of the grape stock is
   strengthened by our results. Root development varied between row sides.
   Fercal developed less roots on the eastern side of the row while T5C,
   TK5BB, TFSO4, Georgikon28 developed larger root system on the west side
   of the rows. We conclude that root system development is affected by
   soil physical and chemical properties, but differences according to the
   rootstock-scion combinations on similar types of soil exist.},

Abstract = {Selection of a suitable rootstock lays the foundation for meeting
   vineyard, grape and wine objectives. Tolerance to biotic and abiotic
   conditions is a determining factor. Despite the significance of the
   grapevine root system in vegetative and reproductive growth as well as
   grape and wine composition and quality, root behaviour under an array of
   very complex and integrated environmental impacting factors is largely
   unknown and research in this regard is surprisingly limited. In this
   paper, a compilation of some of the research done over many years on
   root system behaviour is presented. Various aspects of the interaction
   between the root system and the complex natural environment in which it
   grows as well as commonly known viticulture practices are discussed.
   Results obtained under controlled and field conditions are shown.
   Physical and chemical properties and pre-establishment preparation of
   the soil have defining effects on metabolic behaviour and spatial
   distribution (horizontally and vertically) of roots. Alleviation of soil
   impediments to root penetration provides the best possible basis for
   above-ground growth. The health status of plant material, genetic
   characteristics and grafting and nursery processes have a steering
   impact on the ability of the root system to perform within biotic and
   abiotic constraints of the soil environment to such an extent that
   expectations in terms of growth, yield and grape quality of the scion
   are met. Agronomic practices exert a further tailoring impact on root
   system performance and support to above-ground growth. The study of only
   above-ground factors is clearly not sufficient to explain vineyard
   behaviour. Intensified inter-disciplinary research efforts are required
   in our quest to understand scion-root system inter-relationships and to
   control scion behaviour in order to facilitate greater sustainability in

Abstract = {Climate change is modifying the environmental conditions in all the
   vineyards across the world. The expected effects on grape and wine
   production can be positive in some grape growing regions, but under
   warmer or dryer conditions the volume and quality of the wines produced
   can be impaired. Adaptation to new climatic conditions includes changes
   in the cultivation areas, changes in the vineyard or cellar practices,
   and use of new rootstock x scion combinations. In this article, we
   provide an overview of the possible effects of climate change on
   grapevine physiology and berry quality and we describe the more
   important traits and the genetic variability that can be used in the
   adaptation process. We also present the modern techniques that can be
   used by researchers to identify the links between genomic information
   and behaviors in the field. Finally, we discuss the existing
   opportunities in the present grapevine collections and the strategies
   that can be used by breeders to create new varieties.},

Title = {Conventional Citrus of Some Scion/Rootstock Combinations Show Field
   Tolerance under High Huanglongbing Disease Pressure},
Journal = {HORTSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {127-132},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) has become endemic in Florida,
   with estimates that greater than 80\% of citrus trees are currently
   infected. Although there are no commercial citrus varieties with strong
   HLB resistance, some field tolerance has been observed in trees exposed
   to the disease after they were mature. There is great urgency to
   identify citrus which may permit `economic citrus production where HLB
   is endemic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess field
   tolerance to HLB. To expedite the trial due to urgency, nursery trees
   were purchased on rootstock varieties as available. The trial included
   the following unbalanced scion/rootstock combinations: `Hamlin/Kinkoji',
   `Hamlin/Cleopatra', `Temple/Cleopatra', `Fallglo/Kinkojr, `Sugar
   Belle/Sour Orange', `Tango/Kuharske', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji', with most
   comparisons based solely on scion/rootstock combinations. A randomized
   complete block experiment was established at Fort Pierce, FL, in Sept.
   2010. All trees exhibited symptoms of HLB and tested positive for the
   Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) bacterium by Oct. 2012, with
   similar titers {[}directly assessed as cycle threshold (Ct) using
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)] measured for all
   scion/rootstocks at most sample dates, but early titer development in
   `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' was significantly lower than several other
   scion/rootstocks. Across all time -points, `Fallglo/Kinkoy had the
   lowest rating of distinctive HLB mottling and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' had the
   highest rating, but `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' had the highest percentage
   of leaves affected. After 5 years, `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' and
   `Tango/Kuharske' had the greatest overall increase in trunk diameter,
   and were among the healthiest in overall appearance. In Oct. 2015,
   `SugarBelle/Sour Orange' and `Tango/Kuharske' trees had significantly
   greater fruit load (80-88 fruit/tree) followed by `Temple/Cleopatra' and
   `Fallglo/Kinkojr (31-35 fruit/tree) while `Hamlin/Kinkoji',
   `Hamlin/Cleopatra', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji' produced less than 20 fruit
   per tree. Despite becoming infected by CLas in less than 2 years after
   planting, the trees continued to grow and all scion/rootstocks displayed
   increasing fruit production, although very low in `Hamlin/Kinkoji',
   `Hamlin/Cleopatra', and `Ruby Red/Kinkoji'. Growth and fruit production
   in the highest performing scion/rootstocks were likely less than would
   be expected for healthy trees, but these results are promising, with
   markedly better response of some scion/rootstocks with mandarin hybrid
   scions compared with trees with sweet orange or grapefruit scions.
   Larger fully replicated trials are underway. It is noteworthy that the
   most pronounced HLB symptoms and higher early pathogen titer, which are
   the two criteria most widely used in assessing HLB resistance, were not
   associated with the lowest growth and cropping, and focus on early
   symptomatic traits when screening for resistance may obscure important
   disease tolerance.},

Abstract = {Table grapes are one of the most productive and economically relevant
   fruit crops worldwide. Table grape production characterizes by high
   water productivity but also by an intensive use of water, which puts
   pressure on local/regional water resources, particularly in dry regions
   (e.g. South Mediterranean, Northeast and Southeast of Brazil). Climate
   change and scarcer water resources make the problem more severe in those
   areas. Meanwhile, consumer's demand for quality and sustainable
   production is increasing and environmental issues are becoming critical
   for competiveness. In this context, table grape ``industry{''} needs
   solutions to promote water savings, sustain yield, quality and profit.
   Deficit irrigation emerged as a tool to mitigate the negative impact of
   drought on yield and quality and to save water in modern irrigated
   viticulture. Our aim is to describe the potential benefits of deficit
   irrigation in table grape production namely in what concerns water
   savings and berry quality. Previous literature shows that the effect of
   deficit irrigation on water savings varies with the genotype (scion and
   rootstock), the environmental conditions as well as the adopted
   agronomic strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive and up-to-date
   overview on the eco-physiological basis of deficit irrigation strategies
   and their role on growth, yield and berry quality (biophysical and
   biochemical) in table grape. Complementary crop management strategies to
   guarantee a more sustainable use of water (e.g. higher water use
   efficiency), improved berry quality and smaller environmental impact of
   table grape production are presented and discussed.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the occurrence of changes in

   design with three treatments (genotypes) and ten plants per plot.
   Vegetative growth of grapevine rootstocks and anatomic variables, by the
   analysis of histological sections performed in the apex, middle, and
   base portion of the stem, were evaluated. The differences in the
   vascular system became larger from the apex to the base. The SO4 and
   Paulsen 1103 genotypes had higher xylem area in the base of the stem, of
   2.61 and 2.51 mm(2), respectively, and larger diameter of vessels, of
   45.8 and 47.2 mu m, respectively, in comparison to 101-14 MGT that
   showed 1.60 mm(2) for xylem and 34.1 mu m for vessel diameter.
   Modifications also occurred for the frequency of vessels. The xylem
   area, diameter, and frequency of vessels are related to rootstock
   vegetative growth. Vascularization pattern changes may be a criterion
   for the choice of rootstocks, due to their effect on the physiological

   A two year study was carried out in pots to assess performances of the
   two new M1 and M3 rootstocks vs. those of the commercial rootstocks
   1103P and 101-14. Potted vines of M1, M3, 1103P and 101-14 rootstocks
   were grown in a calcareous and non calcareous soil and for two
   consecutive seasons subjected to three N supply levels at 0, 2 and 4g of
   N per pot. Vegetative growth, leaf gas exchange, leaf greenness index
   (GI) and leaf blade nutrition were assessed. M1 and 1103P were the least
   vigorous genotypes in terms of total pruning weight; M1 also manifested
   a stronger apical dominance. Both M rootstocks and 101-14 showed
   increased leaf WUE at both N supply levels which was due to ability to
   maintain, at increasing N supply, similar leaf assimilation rates while
   significantly reducing leaf transpiration. Common tendency of any
   rootstocks was that increasing N supply corresponded to lowered leaf
   concentration of K, P, Mg and B. M1 was able to combine a series of
   desirable features including lower vigor, strong apical dominance,
   higher WUE at increasing N supply and quite well balanced leaf
   nutritional pattern. In the present trial M3 did not have the expected

Abstract = {Grapes are a widely cultivated and economically important crop. Climate
   change is increasing the focus and investment on the development of more
   drought resistant varieties. However, markets often dictate specific
   grape varieties that can be grown and sold. Thus growers are
   increasingly interested in conferring particular traits of interest
   (e.g., drought tolerance) through grafting onto rootstocks. A major goal
   is to develop rootstocks that can influence scion growth and
   productivity under drought; particularly those that can increase water
   conservation through reducing the need for irrigation while ameliorating
   negative impacts on yields. Growers and scientists recognize that
   rootstocks have a profound influence on vine physiology (e.g., stomatal
   conductance, photosynthesis, water status), productivity (e.g., growth,
   fruit yields, fruit composition), and drought resistance. The challenge
   is to better understand the exact mechanisms through which rootstocks
   manifest these effects and thus build the knowledge necessary to drive
   the development of rootstocks with predictable effects on the scion. The
   aim of this review is to explore our current understanding of the
   mechanisms by which grapevine rootstocks influence scion growth and
   stress response; specifically focused on the integration of vine growth
   and productivity under water deficit.},

Abstract = {Climate change models predict that sites suitable for vineyards will
   shift over the next 50 years. In part through rootstocks and hybrid
   scions bred from North American Vitis species, cultivated grapevines can
   thrive in a variety of environments. However, relatively little is known
   about the range of climatic conditions under which natural populations
   of native North American Vitis species occur. In this study, we use
   geographic information system data to describe the climatic niches of 13
   North American Vitis species that are distributed east of the Rocky
   Mountains and to compare climatic niches in a phylogenetic context. We
   extracted bioclimatic data from thousands of locality points and
   performed univariate and multivariate statistical analyses for each
   Vitis species. We then used these data to determine if phylogenetic
   relatedness was associated with similarities or differences in climatic
   niches. Finally, we performed Maxent modeling and multivariate
   environmental similarity surfaces analysis to identify suitable climate
   space for each species throughout the United States. Our results
   indicate Vitis species occur under a wide range of climatic conditions,
   including warm and wet (V. shuttleworthii), warm and dry (V.
   mustangensis), cold and wet (V. labrusca), and cold and dry (V. riparia)
   climates. Some clades within Vitis exhibit similarities in their
   climatic niches (niche conservatism), while others include species with
   notably different climatic niches (niche divergence). Additionally, we
   identify novel geographic locations where some species could potentially
   flourish. These data provide valuable insights into the abiotic
   environments occupied by natural populations of North American
   grapevines and may be useful in the development of rootstock genotypes
   to suit specific climates now and in the future.},

Abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (RKNs) Meloidogyne spp. cause major damage to
   cultivated woody plants. Among them, Prunus, grapevine and coffee are
   the crops most infested by worldwide polyphagous species and species
   with a more limited distribution and/or narrower host range. The
   identification and characterization of natural sources of resistance are
   important steps to develop RKN control strategies. In woody crops,
   resistant rootstocks genetically different from the scion of agronomical
   interest may be engineered. We describe herein the interactions between
   RKNs and different woody crops, and highlight the plant species in which
   resistance and corresponding resistance (R) genes have been discovered.
   Even though grapevine and, to a lesser extent, coffee have a history of
   rootstock selection for RKN resistance, few cases of resistance have
   been documented. By contrast, in Prunus, R genes with different spectra
   have been mapped in plums, peach and almond and can be pyramided for
   durable resistance in interspecific rootstocks. We particularly discuss
   here the Ma Toll/interleukin-1 receptor-like-nucleotide
   binding-leucine-rich repeat gene from Myrobalan plum, one of the longest
   plant R genes cloned to date, due to its unique biological and
   structural properties. RKN R genes in Prunus will enable us to carry out

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {The present work investigates the interactions between soil content,
   rootstock, and scion by focusing on the effects of roostocks and
   nitrogen supply on grape berry content. Scions of Cabernet Sauvignon
   (CS) and Pinot Noir (PN) varieties were grafted either on Riparia Gloire
   de Montpellier (RGM) or 110 Richter (110R) rootstock. The 4
   rooststock/scion combinations were fertilized with 3 different levels of
   nitrogen after fruit set. Both in 2013 and 2014, N supply increased N
   uptake by the plants, and N content both in vegetative and reproductory
   organs. Rootstock, variety and year affected berry weight at harvest,
   while nitrogen did not affect significantly this parameter. Grafting on
   RGM consistently increased berry weight compared to 110R. PN
   consistently produced bigger berries than CS. CS berries were heavier in
   2014 than in 2013, but the year effect was less marked for PN berries.
   The berries were collected between veraison and maturity, separated in

   HPLC-DAD, which is a fully quantitative technique. The data show complex
   responses of the metabolite content (sugars, organic acids, amino acids,
   anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols/procyanidins, stilbenes,
   hydroxycinnamic, and hydroxybenzoic acids) that depend on the rootstock,
   the scion, the vintage, the nitrogen level, the berry compartment. This
   opens a wide range of possibilities to adjust the content of these
   compounds through the choice of the roostock, variety and nitrogen

Abstract = {The present study was conducted to determine the phenological changes in
   leaf nutrient contents in 10-years Vitis labrusca L. grapes grafted on
   140Ru, 5BB and 5C rootstocks. In the experiment, changes of leaf macro
   and micro element contents from bud burst to post harvest period were
   investigated in the heavy clay soil conditions. Nutrient contents of
   leaf blades showed varied depending on the phenological stages and
   rootstocks (P < 0.01). P, K, Mg and Ca levels of leaf blade exhibited
   significant differences based on rootstocks and phenological periods
   between blooming and veraison. While Zn level was obtained sufficient on
   5BB of grafted grapevines, it was found to be insufficient in grapevines
   grafted on 140Ru and 5C rootstocks. In general, grapevines were found
   insufficient for P, K and Mg nutrients. Total chlorophyll contents of
   leaves were found at high in the blooming period. Although the highest
   chlorophyll contents were found in the blooming period, it was
   determined at the lowest through to harvest. In the study, 5BB rootstock
   was evaluated to be favorable in terms of nutrient uptake.},

Abstract = {In the present study the effect of different rootstocks, namely 775
   Paulsen, 779 Paulsen (Vitis berlandieri x Vitis rupestris), Rugged 225,
   420A and Kober 5BB (Vitis berlandieri x Vitis riparia) was evaluated on
   the anthocyanins and flavans profiles both in grapes and in relative
   wines obtained from Greco Nero n. vines grown in pots.
   Rootstocks effects on secondary metabolites such as anthocyanins and
   tannins were quite evident both on grapes and on wines. The highest
   levels of anthocyanins was observed in berries of vines grafted onto 775
   Paulsen and Kober 5BB. The corresponding wines presented greater color
   intensity, thus reflecting the anthocyanic content.
   On the base of Principal Component Analysis, no distinction based on
   genetic background was evident on the base of anthocyanic profile both
   on grapes and wines. Conversely, grapes grafted on rootstocks Vitis
   berlandieri x rupestris differentiated from rootstocks Vitis berlandieri
   x riparia on the base of flavans variables, even this distinction was
   lost after winemaking.
   The results of this paper suggested that a specific affinity between a
   certain genotype and a rootstock goes beyond the constitutive
   genetics-of the rootstock itself and becomes peculiar of each

Abstract = {Agrobacterium vitis is responsible for the crown gall disease of
   grapevine which breaks the grapevine trunk vascular system. Nutrient
   flow is prevented by crown gall and it leads to weak growth and death of
   the plants. It can be destructive disease often encountered in vineyards
   and it can be spread in cuttings for propagation. Thermotherapy
   treatment is an alternative method for eradicating A. vitis from
   grapevine cuttings but effects of thermotherapy treatments on dormant
   vine tissue, bud vitality, rooting and shooting of the propagation
   materials are not yet fully understood. In this research, it is aimed to
   determine the effects of thermotherapy treatment (Hot water treatment)
   on callus formation (at the basal part and grafting point), grafted vine
   quality (shoot length, shoot width, root number, shooting and rooting
   development, fresh and dry weight of shoots and roots) and final take in
   the grafted vine production. Experiment was conducted in the nursery of
   Manisa Viticultural Research Institute. Rootstocks (Kober 5BB, Couderc
   1613 and 41B) and scions (Sultan 7 and Manisa sultani) were hot-water
   treated at 50 degrees C for 30 minutes which is the most common
   technique against Agrobacterium vitis. After thermotherapy treatment,
   all rootstocks were grafted with Sultan 7 and Manisa sultanivarieties.
   They were kept for 22 days in callusing room for callus development and
   then they were planted in polyethlyene bags for rooting. At the end of
   the study, significant treatment x rootstock interaction were observed
   for the final take of Sultan 7 variety. Thermotherapy treated of
   1613C/Sultan 7 combinations had more final take than the control
   (untreated) group. For instance, hot water treated cuttings of
   1613C/Sultan 7 combinations had 75\% final take while the control group
   had the 70\%. Also there were not observed any adverse effects of HWT on

Abstract = {Due to the competition for scarce water resources in the State of
   California and elsewhere around the world, agriculture needs to become
   more water use efficient. There are numerous means available to aid in
   the irrigation of vineyards to minimize applied water amounts and
   maintain yields of high quality. This paper will review various methods
   to assess grapevine water status and estimate vineyard
   evapo-transpiration (ETc) and provide an update with data recently
   obtained using numerous grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars and V.
   vinifera scions grafted onto different rootstocks. A review of the use
   of leaf (Psi(l)), stem (Psi(stem)) and pre-dawn (Psi(PD)) water
   potentials as a means to assess vine water status will be followed by
   current research demonstrating that midday Psi(l) is the most convenient
   and accurate method to use. It will be demonstrated that all grape
   cultivars identified by many to date as isohydric (such as `Grenache',
   `Tempranillo' and `Touriga Nacional') responded to water deficits
   similarly to anisohydric cultivars (such as `Cabernet Sauvignon',
   `Syrah' and `Montepulciano') when grown in a replicated field trial.
   Several factors will be discussed as to why cultivars initially
   categorized as isohydric by others were not found so here. Lastly, the
   utilization of the amount of shade (percent shaded area) cast on the
   ground at solar noon (or percent ground cover) provides reliable
   estimates of a vineyard's seasonal crop coefficients (Kc) using the
   following equation: K-c = \% shaded area {*} 0.017. The value of 0.017
   has been found in several other studies in which vine ETc was measured
   with weighing lysimeters in Europe.},

Abstract = {Drought-tolerant rootstocks are expected to improve the grapevine
   response to water deficit by improving the water uptake and transport
   and by reducing the water loss in leaves by root-to-shoot signalling.
   Nevertheless, the mechanisms of rootstocks' tolerance to drought are not
   yet fully understood. The aims of this study were to evaluate the
   adaptation of Vitis sp. leaf stomata (density and size) to soil water
   deficit via interaction with different rootstocks known for their
   drought tolerance characteristics. Greenhouse trials were carried out in
   controlled ambient conditions. `Pinotage' (Vitis vinifera L.) grafted
   onto two rootstocks (99Richter and 110Richter) were used. Half of the
   grapevines were subjected to severe water constraints. The other half
   were maintained well-watered. The results confirmed that one mechanism
   of `Pinotage' leaf adaptation to water constraints was structural during
   leaf growth, with a reduction in pore size to reduce plant water loss.
   The transpiration rate of leaves was more related to stomatal size than
   density. Future studies with rootstocks with contrasting vigour inducing
   capacity and drought tolerance are needed in order to address the
   rootstock effect on leaf water status related to changes in leaf growth.},

   In the past decade resveratrol, one of the stilbene molecules of grape,
   has been intensively studied and has shown its various promising
   bioactivities. Resveratrol has been detected in several grape organs,
   but the highest concentrations occur in cane and in root. Grafts used in
   viticulture have genetically different root and shoot systems. HPLC-DAD
   method was used to determine the trans-resveratrol content of the
   ethanolic extracts of grape canes and roots. Trans-resveratrol contents
   of the roots ranged from 9.3 to 219.1 mg/kg fresh weight and of the
   canes from 6.7 to 207.9 mg/kg fresh weight. The concentration of
   trans-resveratrol was affected mainly by the year in both cases of the
   scion varieties and we observed significant differences between scion
   -rootstock combinations (p<0.05) under the same cropping conditions.
   Consequently, it was found that grape canes and roots vary considerably

Abstract = {Grapevine production by classical grafting methods and in commercial
   scale emerged over 130 years. This system remained handmade until the
   mid-1950s, when emerged the first international certification programs
   aimed at obtaining mother plants with high viral sanity. The necessity
   to increase the scale of production on industrial model and plant
   material production based on minimum morphological standards appeared at
   the end of the 1960s. Along the 1970s, research unlocked knowledge on
   semi-automated grafting, process hygiene, use of plant growth regulators
   and understanding of physiological events of rootstock-scion
   compatibility, callus formation and rooting. So, until the mid-2000s,
   certification schemes and propagation processes advanced little in
   technical standard. However, grapevine growing areas were expanded and
   demands for plant material increased, and new diseases emerged from
   contaminated nurseries. These new diseases (new viral complexes,
   phytoplasmas, bacteria and grapevine trunk diseases) were discovered by
   high-sensitivity diagnostic methods. Today, there is a new discussion on
   the nursery segment worldwide. The propagation techniques have been
   reviewed from the perspective of reducing the incidence of new diseases
   and minimum physiological damage of nursery plants during the production
   stages. Therefore, technological innovations regarding equipment,
   practices and production inputs have been incorporated in new
   certification schemes. However, despite these advantages, these schemes
   have become more complex and multidisciplinary than previous ones,
   bringing difficulties in adaptation of nurserymen.},

   with a partial developed callus comparing to 2006, while in this
   particular year, for most varieties, the average percentage of the first
   grade grafted vines and the roots dry weight were higher when the `5BB'
   rootstock was used. Lower grafting success of `Borner' rootstock is more
   a result of less developed roots (loamy soils) as compatibility with
   various varieties.},

Abstract = {The interaction between rootstock, scion and the environment may induce
   different responses to the grapevine physiology and, consequently, to
   the grape composition. The vineyards of Serra Gaucha, Brazil, are
   established in different soil types, each with different morphological
   and physicochemical attributes. Moreover, the grapevines are grafted
   onto a diversity of rootstocks. Therefore, this study aimed to determine
   the effect of 15 rootstocks in the composition of the Cabernet Sauvignon
   (CS) grape must. The following rootstocks were used: Rupestris du Lot,
   101-14 Mgt., 3309 C, 420A Mgt., 5BB K, 161-49 C, SO4, Solferino, 1103 P,
   99 R, 110 R, Gravesac, Fercal, Dogridge and Isabel, featuring some
   genetic diversity altogether. The experimental design was in randomized
   blocks with 15 treatments, three replicates, 10 vines per plot. The
   grapes were harvested at maturity for four years, and then crushed for
   winemaking. Next, the grape musts were centrifuged to separate the solid
   phase from the liquid phase, which was used for analyses related to
   sugar, acidity and minerals. The data were submitted to correlation
   analysis and Principal Component Analysis. The main results from the
   average of four years show that, in general, the grape musts of the
   CS/101-14 Mgt., CS/161-49 C, CS/3309 C, CS/Rupestris du Lot and
   CS/Gravesac combinations had high values of density, total soluble
   solids, pH and degrees Brix/titratable acidity ratio, and low titratable
   acidity, which was high with CS/99 R, CS/110 R, CS/Dogridge and CS/1103
   P. Potassium had higher concentrations in the grape musts of CS/SO4 and
   CS/5BB K. Titratable acidity did not correlate with density and total
   soluble solids, but positively correlated with yield. Density, total
   soluble solids, and the concentration of potassium were positively
   correlated with pH.},

Abstract = {Rootstocks are well known as the most efficient way to limit phylloxera.
   However, they can be useful in order to improve grape quality. This
   study aimed to compare the content of polyphenol compounds in vine
   fruits of the cultivar `Regent' grafted on `Couderc 161-49', `Sori',
   `Kober 125AA', `Borner' or `Kober 5BB' rootstocks, or planted on

   (2013-2015) at a research station of the West Pomeranian University of
   Technology Szczecin in Poland. Thirty-three phenolic compounds were
   determined in the juice of examined samples using ultra-pressure liquid
   chromatography with photodiode array and mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA/MS)
   method. A significant influence of rootstock on the content of
   polyphenols in grapes has been proven. The highest content of
   polyphenols was shown in fruits from a scion grafted on `Sori' and
   `Kober 125AA' rootstocks (675 and 643 mg . 100 g(-1) FW, respectively).
   `Borner' and `Kober 5BB' rootstocks did not have a significant influence
   on the creation of polyphenol compounds in comparison to own-root
   plants. In addition, the use of the `Brner' rootstock resulted in fruits
   with an especially low content of phenolic acids.},

   variables related to the physiology of grapevine which were also
   affected by the rootstock. In general, rootstocks had adapted well to
   the environment where the experiment was carried out, giving vigor and
   high yield to Cabernet Sauvignon grapevine, which means that they may be

Title = {Adapting plant material to face water stress in vineyards : which
   physiological targets for an optimal control of plant water status?},
Journal = {OENO ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-179},
Abstract = {Aims: Water scarcity, associated with climate change, is a particular
   threat to the sustainability of viticulture in present areas of
   cultivation, usually prone to drought. Breeding grapevine for reduced
   water use, better water extraction and maintained production (i.e., high
   water use efficiency) is therefore of major interest.
   Methods and results: This requires a comprehensive knowledge of the
   physiological impacts of drought on yield and quality. Attention should
   be paid to those mechanisms involved in the regulation of water status
   in plant tissues, as it is the primary parameter affected by drought.
   Transpiration rate, which has a major influence on plant water status,
   should therefore receive special attention in breeding programs. Beyond
   scions, the role of rootstocks, which have been largely introduced in
   vineyards, should be investigated further as it determines water
   extraction capacity and could modify water balance in grafted plants.
   Conclusion: Here we review recent advances in the characterization of
   genetic variability in the control of water use and water status,
   whether induced by rootstock or scion.
   Significance and impact of the study: This review should help scientists
   in choosing the relevant physiological targets in their research on
   grapevine tolerance to drought, whether for breeding prospects or new
   management practices.},

Abstract = {Since the second half of the XIXth century, grapevine has been grown
   grafted worldwide to cope with Phylloxera. Consequently, the cultivated
   grapevine is a chimeric plant made from two genotypes which interact
   together. The result of this interaction must ensure a balanced
   functioning dedicated to fruit production in terms of quantity and
   quality. The rootstock acts as an interface between the edaphic
   environment and the scion, and is an important component of adaptation
   to environment. The rootstock is responsible for the uptake of water and
   minerals from the soil, feeding the aerial parts in exchange for a
   supply of carbon that is stored as reserves, or used to produce
   nutrients and growth regulators. Many signaling and regulating
   molecules, such as hormones and nucleic acids, are also exchanged
   between the two partners. Despite its importance, little is known about
   the root system and the grafting zone (rootstock-scion interface) in
   grapevine. Until recently the study of rootstocks received little
   attention from growers and the scientific community. New challenges,
   such as climate change, environmental issues, and yield limitations,
   have brought new light on the ``dark side{''} of the grapevine. This
   paper reviews the main physiological processes involved in the
   functioning of roots and the graft interface. Key, challenging
   scientific issues as well as applied perspectives for the industry will
   be discussed.},

Abstract = {Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is routinely grafted, and rootstocks inducing
   drought tolerance represent a source for adapting vineyards to climate
   change in temperate areas. Our goal was to investigate drought stress
   effects on microRNA (miRNA) abundance in a drought-resistant grapevine
   rootstock, M4 (Vitis vinifera 3Vitis berlandieri), compared with a
   commercial cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, using their autografts and
   reciprocal grafts. RNA extracted from roots and leaves of droughted and
   irrigated plants of different graft combinations was used to prepare
   cDNA libraries for small RNA sequencing and to analyze miRNAs by
   quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Measurements
   of leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange, and root hydraulic
   conductance attested that, under irrigation, M4 reduced water loss in
   comparison with cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon mostly through nonhydraulic,
   root-specific mechanisms. Under drought, stomatal conductance decreased
   at similar levels in the two genotypes. Small RNA sequencing allowed the
   identification of 70 conserved miRNAs and the prediction of 28 novel
   miRNAs. Different accumulation trends of miRNAs, observed upon drought
   and in different genotypes and organs, were confirmed by RT-qPCR.
   Corresponding target transcripts, predicted in silico and validated by
   RT-qPCR, often showed opposite expression profiles than the related
   miRNAs. Drought effects on miRNA abundance differed between the two
   genotypes. Furthermore, the concentration of drought-responsive miRNAs
   in each genotype was affected by reciprocal grafting, suggesting either
   themovement of signals inducing miRNA expression in the graft partner
   or, possibly, miRNA transport between scion and rootstock. These results
   open new perspectives in the selection of rootstocks for improving
   grapevine adaptation to drought.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying
   the effect of rootstocks on table grapevines grown under irrigated
   conditions in the arid North macro-zone of Chile.
   Grapevine cv. Red Globe grafted onto three rootstocks (Harmony, Saint
   George and Salt Creek) were studied Structural and physiological
   parameters were monitored at different phenological stages under optimal
   production conditions.
   An outstanding yield increment brought about by the rootstocks Harmony
   and Salt Creek was correlated with increased individual leaf and
   specific leaf area, pruning weight (proxy for total leaf area),
   photosynthesis per unit leaf mass, sugar in leaves and root carbon
   reserves. In addition, these high yielding rootstocks induced higher
   contents of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein of photosystem II
   and total chlorophyll in the leaves of the scion. No correlations of
   yield with traits involved in water use (relative water content or
   instantaneous water use efficiency) were observed.
   The effects of rootstocks on the light capture capacity of the scion
   directly affected carbon assimilation and storage and, accordingly,
   yield. Therefore, the identified traits are valuable targets for
   screening and selecting yield efficient rootstocks for irrigated table

Abstract = {Rootstocks are among the main factors that influence grape development
   as well as fruit and wine composition. In this work, rootstock/scion
   interactions were studied using transcriptomic and metabolic approaches
   on leaves of the ``Gaglioppo{''} variety, grafted onto 13 different
   rootstocks growing in the same vineyard. The whole leaf transcriptome of
   ``Gaglioppo{''} grafted onto five selected rootstocks showed high
   variability in gene expression. In particular, significant modulation of
   transcripts linked to primary and secondary metabolism was observed.
   Interestingly, genes and metabolites involved in defense responses
   (e.g., stilbenes and defense genes) were strongly activated particularly
   in the GAG-41B combination, characterized in addition by the
   down-regulation of abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism. On the contrary, the
   leaves of ``Gaglioppo{''} grafted onto 1103 Paulsen showed an opposite
   regulations of those transcripts and metabolites, together with the
   greater sensitivity to downy mildew in a preliminary in vitro assay.
   This study carried out an extensive transcriptomic analysis of rootstock
   effects on scion leaves, helping to unravel this complex interaction,
   and suggesting an interesting correlation among constitutive stilbenes,

Abstract = {In arid regions under irrigation, vineyards often face water deficit and
   salinity. As these stressors often occur simultaneously, it is difficult
   to assess their individual relative severity. The aim of this work was
   to independently study the physiological responses of grapevine to
   salinity and water deficit, in order to understand and compare their
   effects. A pot trial was designed, grafting Cabernet Sauvignon onto
   1103P and 101-14 Mgt. Three treatments were evaluated: saline irrigation
   (Salino; 80 mM ClNa and field capacity), water stress (EH; 0,4 faction
   of soil transpirable water and 2 mM NaCl) and a control (T; without any
   stress factors, field capacity and 2mM NaCl). After 54 days, Salino
   showed smaller effect on leaf area (AF) and shoot length than EH. AF
   diminished 53\% for Salino, while for EH, AF was reduced in a 78\% with
   respect to T. Shoot length diminished 68\% for Salino and 83\% for EH.
   Total biomass did not show any difference between both stresses, falling
   52\% for both situations. However, regarding the biomass partitioning,
   Salino had higher canopy dry weight while EH showed higher root dry
   weight. Midday leaf water potential was -1,3 MPa for Salino and EH and
   -0,9 MPa for T. Although stomatal conductance was similarly reduced for
   both stress treatments (-41\% compared to T), with no differences
   between rootstocks; an interaction was found between the type of stress
   and rootstock for net photosynthesis. Finally, 1103P showed a higher Na+
   exclusion power than 101-14Mgt (accumulating 21\% less Na+ in the
   plant). Even though the behavior of the Cabernet sauvignon scion was
   similar for both rootstocks, the higher exculsion that 1103p showed may
   indicate possible better performances upon salinity.},

Abstract = {Graft is a union between two separate species or cultivars, which
   produces a chimera plant with new qualities-as rootstock affects scion
   growth, yield, and adaptability to different environmental conditions.
   In Vitis, it is possible to generate rootstock/scion combinations that
   produce a desired drought stress effect crucial for high-quality wine
   production, though the mechanisms for such interactions are complex and
   poorly understood. The current study was done on vines with an identical
   scion (Vitis vinifera `Cabernet Sauvignon') grafted on three different
   rootstocks-either Riparia Gloire, Paulsen 1103 or 420A-in attempt to
   explain the differences in water status by examining the underlying
   anatomical constraints and calculated theoretical hydraulic
   conductivity. There was a significant difference in physiological
   responses and yield between the grafts. Riparia Gloire grafts had the
   lowest water potentials and the highest quality grapes, together with
   low root, scion stem, and branch theoretical hydraulic conductivity. In
   scions grafted on Riparia Gloire, the annual growth rings were
   significantly narrower than in the other two grafts, causing a
   significantly lower theoretical hydraulic conductivity per annual ring.
   The narrow annual ring size in scion stem was imposed by the
   morphological constraint of the stem size. In hydraulically inferior
   Riparia Gloire grafts, the difference was disproportionally large, with
   a wide scion grafted on a very narrow rootstock, and Paulsen 1103 had
   the smoothest graft union. Our results indicate that the ability to
   develop stronger drought stress in Vitis grafts depends on
   rootstock-imposed morphological restriction of hydraulic conductivity.},

Abstract = {The French-American interspecific hybrid grape cultivar `Chambourcin'
   (26.205 Joannes-Seyve) was planted in 2004 at Mountain Grove, Mo., on
   seven different rootstocks (3309C, 101-14 Mgt, 5BB, SO4, 110R, 1103P,
   Freedom). Own-rooted `Chambourcin' was also grown. The site
   characteristics are latitude 37 degrees 9' N, longitude 92 degrees 16'
   W, elevation 442 m, USDA plant hardiness zone 6a, and a Viraton silt
   loam soil with 2 to 5\% slope. The soil is characterized as acidic,
   moderately well-drained, and slowly permeable with chert and fragipan in
   the subsoil. This soil restricts root growth, is prone to drought, and
   reduces vine vigor. Rootstocks were tested in a replicated trial during
   the years 2009 to 2013 to improve scion productivity. `Chambourcin'
   grafted to 3309C, 5BB, and 1103P had significantly higher yield per vine
   compared to own-rooted. The remaining rootstocks were not significantly
   different from own-rooted. Vines grafted to 3309C and 1103P had
   significantly higher pruning weight per vine compared to own-rooted in
   three years. The remaining rootstocks were not significantly different
   from own-rooted. Average cluster and berry weights were not
   significantly affected by rootstocks in all years, but own-rooted vines
   were significantly lower in some years. Juice soluble solids was
   significantly higher for own-rooted compared to some rootstocks in two
   years, a likely result of lower yields on these vines. Juice titratable
   acidity was not affected by rootstock, and pH was affected one year.
   Crop load (yield to cane pruning weight ratio) ranged from 12 to 15.
   Lower crop loads would likely have improved fruit composition.
   Productivity of `Chambourcin', a cultivar prone to low vigor when grown
   on a restrictive soil, can be improved when grafted to rootstocks. The
   rootstocks 3309C, 5BB, and 1103P appeared best.},

Abstract = {In many fruit species, including grapevine, grafting is used to improve

   conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying the rootstock control of
   scion development are still poorly understood. The ability of rootstocks
   to regulate nitrogen uptake and assimilation may contribute to this
   control. A split-root system was used to grow heterografted grapevines
   and to investigate the molecular responses to changes in nitrate
   availability of two rootstocks known to affect scion growth differently.
   Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing was performed on root samples
   collected 3 and 24 h after nitrogen supply. The results demonstrated a
   common response involving nitrogen-related genes, as well as a more
   pronounced transcriptomic reprogramming in the genotype conferring the
   lower scion growth. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis
   allowed the identification of co-regulated gene modules, suggesting a
   role for nitrate transporter 2 family genes and some transcription
   factors as main actors controlling this genotype-dependent response to
   heterogeneous nitrogen supply. The relationship between nitrate,
   ethylene, and strigolactone hormonal pathways was found to differ
   between the two genotypes. These findings indicated that the genotypes
   responded differently to heterogeneous nitrogen availability, and this
   may contribute to their contrasting effect on scion growth.},

Abstract = {The rootstock may affect the scion growth by influencing its water
   potential, nutrient status, vigor, stress tolerance, or by interactions
   between rootstock and scion cultivars, leading to changes in fruit
   quality. To study this statement, `Ruby Roman' grapevine was grafted on
   two different rootstocks, `Kober 5BB' {[}'5BB(2x)'] (a semi-dwarf
   rootstock) and `Hybrid Franc' {[}'HF(2x)'] (a vigorous rootstock), and
   their colchicine-induced autotetraploid rootstocks {[}'5BB(4x)' and
   `HF(4x)']. We found that `5BB(4x)' rootstock could decrease the
   vegetative growth of the `Ruby-Roman' grapevine, consequently enhancing
   the skin coloration and sugar content of the berries. To observe the
   physiological changes between the diploid and the corresponding
   tetraploid rootstocks, we measured the endogenous plant hormone content,
   including abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and
   trans-zeatin (tZ) in tissues of shoot apex, root, and berry skin. On
   veraison, the ABA content in the `5BB(4x)' berries was the highest among
   the four types of grafted grapevines, and the IAA and tZ content in
   these berries tended to be higher as well. However, in the vegetative
   tissues (shoot apex and roots), the ABA content in the two types of
   `5BB' grapevine was lower than that in the two types of `HF' grapevine.
   In contrast, the IAA and tZ content in the two types of `5BB' grapevine
   were higher than those in the two types of `HF' grapevine.},

Abstract = {During five years of observation the effects of different rootstocks
   combined with `Gruner Veltliner' on a heavy mar soil were investigated.
   The locally important rootstocks Kober SBB, SO4, Teleki 5C as well as
   the French rootstock varieties Fercal and Gravesac were used. We gained
   physiological, phenological and agronomical data, and furthermore
   experimental wines were vinified and sensorilly evaluated. Whereas the
   rootstocks Kober 5BB, SO4 and Fercal showed an acceptable performance
   under the specific conditions, the rootstocks Teleki 5C and Gravesac
   suffered due to the structure of the soil. It could be registered that
   Fercal retarded and Gravesac prematured bud break compared to the
   Berlandieri x Riparia rootstocks. The sensitivity for colure during
   flowering is enormous in Gravesac and rendered almost yearly especially
   loose clusters with low yield. The rootstock Teleki 5C even showed a
   tendency for heavier colure, but in that case due to the favorably
   changed structure of the grape it could be seen as an improvement. The
   yield was not essentially diminished. The capacity for mineral uptake
   from the soil is reduced by Gravesac and the scion `Griiner Veltliner'
   showed deficiencies of N, K, Ca and P. Finally the color of leaves and
   frequently appearance of chlorosis confirmed the problems of Gravesac
   with the soil conditions. On the other hand the viticultural problems
   were not reflected within the overall wine quality. The low yield
   allowed higher sugar contents than with other rootstocks, lower acidity
   and high rating values in an overall evaluation. Despite the agreeable
   wine quality this rootstock is not recommended due to sensitivity
   against chlorosis, low yield and high losses of vines. In contrary
   Fercal could reach a well-balanced production comparable in quality and
   yield to the already established rootstocks. Only SO4 was more fruitful,
   but with lower ripeness. Evaluation of wine quality resulted in a middle
   position within the group of well-known rootstocks with little
   differences for Fercal.},

Abstract = {This research investigated physiological and biochemical changes at
   rootstock-scion union of graft combinations between Iranian rootstocks
   and Asgari scion in response to NAA and BAP application. Grafting cuts
   of scion and rootstock were dipped into NAA (0, 200 and 400 mg.L-1) and
   BAP (0, 250 and 500 mg.L-1) solutions for 30 min, immediately after the
   cuttings were grafted using the wedge grafting technique. The highest
   successful grafting rate (82\%) was recorded with Asgari-Asgari
   combination treated with 200 mg.L-1 NAA+ 500 mg.L-1 BAP. Treating the
   graft cut-surfaces with 200 mg.L-1 NAA+ 500 mg.L-1 BAP caused the lowest
   H2O2 and MDA contents. Among all the graft combinations, the highest
   increase in chlorophyll content with a high photosynthesis efficiency
   occurred in Asgari-Shahani when treated with 200 mg.L-1 NAA+ 500 mg.L-1
   BAP. The graft union formation in the presence of 200 mg.L-1 NAA + 500
   mg.L-1 BAP application enhanced CAT and POX activities. In conclusion,
   treatment of graft zone with 200 mg.L-1 NAA+ 500 mg.L-1 BAP enhanced
   antioxidant activities and reduced lipid peroxidation in scion leaves.
   However, several grapevine rootstocks tested in our research were also

Abstract = {In Brazil, the producers have changed used rootstocks to get more vigor
   to scion. Rootstocks change the distribution of bud fruitfulness over
   grapevine shoots and the expression of the bud fruitfulness into fruit
   yield. Hence, these modification could alter ideal pruning length. In
   this way, it was evaluated bud fruitfulness, fruit yield and quality of
   `Niagara Rosada' grapevine grafted onto rootstocks: `IAC 766', `IAC
   572', `IAC 313', `IAC 571-6', and `Riparia do Traviu', which `IAC 766'
   is the most used rootstock in Sao Paulo State, nowadays. The evaluations
   were performed over three crop seasons, in a vineyard located in
   Louveira, SP. Two evaluations were performed in Brazilian traditional
   season, and one crop pruning was performed in Brazilian summer, called
   ``off-season{''}. In traditional seasons, the bud fruitfulness was
   evaluated from the first to fourth bud in 2014 and to the fifth in 2015.
   In the off-season, bud fruitfulness was evaluated from the fifth to
   eighth bud. Fruit yield and quality were also evaluated over the three
   production cycles. Bud fruitfulness of `Niagara Rosada' grafted onto the
   evaluated rootstocks showed that this characteristic was more affected
   by the environmental conditions, confirmed due to alteration of bud
   fruitfulness through production cycles. Additionally, no effect of
   rootstock was observed on fruit yield, and quality of `Niagara Rosada'.
   Only isolated variations were detected, and these are not enough to
   confirm the influence of rootstocks on scion of `Niagara Rosada'.
   Although no effect of rootstocks on bud fruitfulness, fruit yield and
   quality has been observed in the evaluated conditions, all rootstocks
   are recommended to be used in combination with `Niagara Rosada'.},

Abstract = {Under salinity, Vitis spp. rootstocks can mediate salt (NaCl) exclusion
   from grafted V. vinifera scions enabling higher grapevine yields and
   production of superior wines with lower salt content. Until now, the
   genetic and mechanistic elements controlling sodium (Na+) exclusion in
   grapevine were unknown.
   Using a cross between two Vitis interspecific hybrid rootstocks, we
   mapped a dominant quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with leaf
   Na+ exclusion (NaE) under salinity stress. The NaE locus encodes six
   high-affinity potassium transporters (HKT). Transcript profiling and
   functional characterization in heterologous systems identified VisHKT1;
   1 as the best candidate gene for controlling leaf Na+ exclusion.
   We characterized four proteins encoded by unique VisHKT1; 1 alleles from
   the parents, and revealed that the dominant HKT variants exhibit greater
   Na+ conductance with less rectification than the recessive variants.
   Mutagenesis of VisHKT1; 1 and TaHKT1.5-D from bread wheat, demonstrated
   that charged amino acid residues in the eighth predicted transmembrane
   domain of HKT proteins reduces inward Na+ conductance, and causes inward
   rectification of Na+ transport.

Abstract = {The development of biological control agents (BCAs) is a promising and
   environmentally friendly method to control plant pathogens. In a
   grapevine nursery greenhouse and for the first time on grafted cuttings
   (scion cv. Cabernet sauvignon), this two-year study demonstrated the
   significant efficacy of the oomycete Pythium oligandrum as a BCA against
   two major aggressive fungal pathogens, Neofusicoccum parvum and
   Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, which are involved in grapevine trunk
   diseases (GTDs). By considering the reduction in necrosis lengths within
   the scion stem, treatments with P. oligandrum alone showed the greatest
   efficacy against the two pathogens (overall average efficacy of 48.3\%).
   This major result was obtained during the two-year bioassay and in
   cuttings grafted on the two widely used rootstocks, 101-14 and SO4. The
   biocontrol efficacies of two bacterial strains previously isolated from
   vineyards, Pantoea agglomerans and Bacillus pumilus, were also assessed,
   separately or in combination with P. oligandrum. Treatments with each
   bacterial strain were less effective than treatments with P. oligandrum,
   and the efficacies were not improved when they were applied in
   combination with the oomycete.},

Abstract = {Fruits of citrus cultivars contain bioflavonoids and some other
   important secondary metabolites in pharmaceutical and nutritional
   industries. The present experiment was designed to investigate the
   correlation between the content of flavonoid components like naringin,
   hesperidin, and neohesperidin of the scions fruits and the same
   parameters in rootstocks fruits. Six-year-old trees including four
   citrus cultivars of `Moro', `Mars', `Salustiana', and `Italian' which
   were previously grafted on the four different rootstocks including
   `Yuzu', `Shelmahalleh', `Citromelo', and `Sour orange' were selected as
   experimental trees. The content of the mentioned flavonoids was
   investigated in the peel and pulp of the fruits of both scions and
   rootstocks. The results showed that the measured parameters were
   significantly influenced by scions, rootstocks, and tissues. Based on
   the obtained results, it can be suggested that the accumulation of
   chemicals in citrus fruit depends on genetic and inherent abilities of
   the scion, more than what was previously believed, while the rootstock
   can also play an important role in the accumulation of these substances.},

Abstract = {How rootstocks contribute to the control of scion transpiration under
   drought is poorly understood. We investigated the role of root
   characteristics, hydraulic conductance and chemical signals (abscisic
   acid, ABA) in the response of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and
   transpiration (E) to drought in Cabernet Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera)
   grafted onto drought-sensitive (Vitis riparia) and drought-tolerant
   (Vitis berlandieri x Vitis rupestris 11OR) rootstocks. All combinations
   showed a concomitant reduction in g(s) and E, and an increase in xylem
   sap ABA concentration during the drought cycle. Cabernet Sauvignon
   grafted onto 11OR exhibited higher g(s) and E under well-watered and
   moderate water deficit, but all combinations converged as water deficit
   increased. These results were integrated into three permutations of a
   whole-plant transpiration model that couples both chemical (i.e., ABA)
   and hydraulic signals in the modelling of stomatal control. Model
   comparisons revealed that both hydraulic and chemical signals were
   important for rootstock-specific stomatal regulation. Moreover, model
   parameter comparison and sensitivity analysis highlighted two major
   parameters differentiating the rootstocks: (i) ABA biosynthetic activity
   and (ii) the hydraulic conductance between the rhizo-sphere and
   soil-root interface determined by root system architecture. These
   differences in root architecture, specifically a higher root length area
   in 11OR, likely explain its higher E and g(s) observed at low and
   moderate water deficit.},

Abstract = {Background and AimsThe main objective of the study was to test if
   differences in leaf composition induced by the rootstock could be
   detected through non-invasive fluorescence sensor technology.
   Methods and ResultsMultiplex Research measurements on three dates over
   three consecutive growing seasons showed that Pinot Noir (Vitis vinifera
   L.) grafted onto high vigour rootstocks (125AA and SO4 with double the
   amount of pruning mass) had also leaves with high chlorophyll index and
   low flavonol index when compared to that of Riparia and Schwarzmann.
   Multiplex measurements on-the-go' gave similar results. Amino acids in
   juices, however, was not directly related to vine vigour as values for
   R110 and Riparia were significantly lower than that for 125AA.
   ConclusionsThe applicability of new optical sensors used both manually
   or on-the-go' to characterise rootstock influence on scion leaf
   composition was established and could be related to vine vigour
   conferred by the rootstock.
   Significance of the StudyOur study provides evidence that non-invasive
   fluorescence sensors used for the first time over consecutive growing
   seasons and dates are able to reveal differences in scion leaf
   composition induced by the rootstock in relation to vine vigour and to
   provide the basis for a better understanding of its impact on fruit and

Abstract = {In grafted plants, rootstocks assure the mineral nutrition of the scion
   and modify its development. In this study, we show that two grapevine
   rootstock genotypes have different shoot branching architectures when
   cultivated as cuttings and that this trait is transmitted to the scion
   when grafted. Shoot branching plasticity in response to nitrogen supply
   was also studied. As strigolactones are known to have a role in the
   regulation of shoot development in response to nutrient availability,
   their involvement in the control of scion architecture by the rootstock
   was investigated. Functional characterization of putative grapevine
   strigolactone biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis mutants or grapevine
   cell suspensions showed similar functions to those of Arabidopsis. Both
   rootstocks produced strigolactone-like compounds; the quantity produced
   in response to nitrogen treatments differed between the two rootstock
   genotypes and correlated with the expression of putative strigolactone
   biosynthetic genes. Exudation of strigolactone-like compounds by both
   rootstocks was closely related to the developmental pattern of the scion
   in grafted plants. These results suggest that differential regulation of
   strigolactone biosynthesis in response to nitrogen availability may
   contribute to the control of scion development conferred by each
   rootstock genotype.},

Abstract = {In the case of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), leaf blade and petioles at
   different sampling times are used for nutritional diagnosis and planning
   fertilization practices. However, reference values for each nutrient
   depend on the scion-rootstock combination. In this sense, the current
   study aimed at determining the reliability of leaf blade and petiole for
   diagnosis at different phenological stages and, also, of the period of
   validity, around flowering and veraison, in which the nutrient
   concentrations obtained could be compared with reference values. The
   study was carried out in three vineyards (two planted with cv. Mencia
   and one with cv. Souson) within the Ribeira Sacra Designation of Origin
   (NW Spain). Blades and petioles were collected throughout a growth
   season (2014) and total concentrations of ten essential elements were
   determined in both tissues. In general, petioles showed greater
   variability between replicates for P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn, while N, Fe,
   Mn, Cu, and B presented greater variability in blades. Differences
   between consecutive sampling dates suggest that references for flowering
   were valid until fruit-set. Furthermore, blade and petiole references at
   the beginning of veraison were valid until the advanced ripening stage
   for most nutrients, with the exception of N, P, and Zn. The seasonal
   variation of the concentrations in both tissues confirmed the need for
   reference values for each phenological stage and tissue.},

Abstract = {Citrus fruit is prone to on-tree oleocellosis (OTO), which decreases its
   fresh market value due to deterioration in the fruit peel. This study
   aimed to evaluate the effects of Lichi16-6 trifoliata (Poncircus
   trifoliate, LC), Goutoucheng sour orange (Citrus aurantiunt, GT), and
   Rangpur lime (C. limonia Osbeck, RI) rootstocks on the occurrence of
   OTO, plant water status, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging
   capacity of 12-year-old ``Hamlin{''} sweet orange (C. sinensis Osbeck)
   trees in both 2014 and 2015 cropping seasons. The results showed that
   ``Hamlin{''} trees grown on RI. maintained higher water potential and
   relative water content (RWC) in leaves and fruit peels as well as higher
   transpiration in the morning and afternoon compared with scions grown on
   the other two rootstocks. This improved water status in the morning
   resulted in a lower diurnal range of rind oil release pressure (Delta
   RORP) and the incidence of OTO per tree (IOPT). However, although
   ``Hamlin{''} trees grown on GT had a significantly higher transpiration
   in the morning, leaves of ``Hamlin{''} trees grown on GT had the lowest
   transpiration in the afternoon compared with those grown on the other
   two rootstocks. This exacerbated water status in the afternoon resulted
   in higher malondialdehyde and ROS in leaves and severity of OTO per tree
   (SOPT). In conclusion, the tolerance of ``Hamlin{''} sweet orange grown
   on three rootstocks to OTO was modulated by plant water balance supply
   during OTO-sensitive stage. Also, the Delta RORP and ROS scavenging
   capacity could be selected as indicators to assess IOPT and SOPT,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Peach (Prunus persica L.) rootstock cultivars are typically selected for
   scion compatibility, ease of propagation, vigor, development, flowering
   season, yield, low need for cold temperatures, resistance to diseases,
   effects on the physical-chemical characteristics of the fruit, plant
   longevity and adaptation to adverse edaphoclimatic conditions. However,
   kinetic parameters related to nutrient uptake efficiency are usually not
   considered, such as those of nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4+). N is the
   nutrient that most impacts growth and yield. The objective of this study
   was to show the importance of the kinetic parameters of NO3- and NH4+
   uptake as additional criteria for selecting peach rootstocks. The
   experiment was conducted in a greenhouse. Three rootstock ('AldrighP,
   `Tsukubar and `Clone 15') were grown for 30 days in a pot containing 0.1
   mol L-1 CaSO4 solution to reduce internal reserves of N. Afterwards, the
   plants were placed in Hoagland nutrient solution, where periodic
   collections of the nutrient solution were carried out for three days and
   the concentrations of NO3- and NH4 were determined. After the third day
   of collecting the solution, the plants were collected and then separated
   into leaves, roots and stems. Dry matter and total N content were
   assessed. The kinetic parameters related to NO3- and NH4+ uptake
   (maximum uptake rate - V-max, affinity constant - K-max Minimum
   concentration - C-max, Influx - I) were calculated using Cindtica
   software. The most efficient rootstock for NO3- and NH4+ uptake was
   `Tsukubar, as it showed the lowest values of C-max and K. and the
   highest values of V-max and I-max for NO3- and NH4+. NO3- uptake in
   `Tsukubal' and `Aldrighr showed a two-phase uptake pattern, suggesting
   the presence of low and high affinity transport systems. On the other
   hand, NH4+ uptake in the three cultivars apparently followed a one-phase
   uptake pattern, suggesting the presence of a high affinity transport
   system. The kinetic parameters of NO3- and NH4+ uptake are additional
   criteria that can be used in selecting peach rootstocks, as they
   directly influence shoot and root dry matter production and N
   accumulation in leaves.},

Abstract = {Crop productivity is limited by phosphorus (P) and this will probably
   increase in the future. Rootstocks offer a means to increase the
   sustainability and nutrient efficiency of agriculture. It is known that
   rootstocks alter petiole P concentrations in grapevine. The objective of
   this work was to determine which functional processes are involved in
   genotype-specific differences in scion P content by quantifying P
   uptake, P remobilization from the reserves in the cutting and P
   allocation within the plant in three grapevine genotypes. Cuttings of
   two American rootstocks and one European scion variety were grown in
   sand and irrigated with a nutrient solution containing either high P
   (0.6 mM) or low P (0 mM). The high P solution was labelled with P-32
   throughout the experiment. The grapevine genotypes studied show
   variation in the inhibition of shoot and root biomass in response to low
   P supply, and P supply also affected shoot, but not root, P
   concentrations. Genotype-specific differences in total P content were
   related to differences in P acquisition and utilization efficiencies
   (PAE and PUE, respectively). Phosphorus allocation within the plant was
   not affected by genotype or P supply. The rootstock genotype known to
   confer high petiole P content in the vineyard was associated with a high
   PAE under high P, and a high PUE under low P. This suggests that the
   petiole P concentrations in the vineyard are related to
   genotype-specific differences in PAE and PUE, and that these traits
   could be used for rootstock selection programmes in the future.},

Title = {The Response of Soilless Grown `Michele Palieri' (Vitis vinifera L.)
   Grapevine Cultivar to Deficit Irrigation Under the Effects of Different
   Rootstocks},

Abstract = {Global warming, altering the physiology and irrigation demand of
   grapevines, has already been perceived in certain premium viticulture
   regions across the world. Selection of proper rootstocks for especially
   new cultivars has vital role for asustainable viticulture under
   water-deficit conditions. The grapevine cultivar `Michele Palieri' has
   been finding a good reception on the global markets. The objective of
   this study was to determine the response of `Michele Palieri' cultivar
   to deficit irrigation using different rootstocks with distinct genetic
   origins. Two irrigation regimes (Full Irrigation {[}FI] and Deficit
   Irrigation {[}DI]) were applied to the vines of different grafting
   combinations of `Michele Palieri' with Kober 5 BB, Richter 99, Richter
   110, 140 Ruggeri, 44-53 Malegue or grown on own roots. Two years old
   vines were cultivated in 60L pots containing sterile peat under
   controlled glasshouse conditions. Irrigations were regulated according
   to soil water matric potential (m) levels using tensiometers. The volume
   of the irrigation water that has to be applied to attain 100\% field
   capacity was performed as FI, while 50\% of FI was considered as DI. The
   water was transported directly into the pots by micro-irrigation systems
   consisting of individual spaghetti tubes. The vines of DI treatment
   showed visible symptoms of mild water stress (e.g., loss of turgor in
   shoot tips), but no defoliation or leaf necrosis occurred. DI treatment
   reduced the gs of `Michele Palieri' scion cultivar in varying levels
   depending on the rootstock. DI treatment also affected vegetative growth
   of the scion cultivar in different levels. For example, the greatest
   decrease (26.7\%) in shoot length resulting from DI was determined in
   `Michele Palieri'/5 BB grapevines, followed by own rooted vines
   (13.1\%), while the lowest change (2.4\%) was found in vines grafted on
   110R. Overall findings of this study imply that the rootstocks
   originating from V. berlandiery x V. rupestris hybrids (110R, 99R, 140Ru
   and 44-53M) better performed in a similar genetic aptitude under deficit
   irrigation regime while the rootstock 5 BB (V. berlandiery x
   V.rupestris) showed more susceptible responses. On the other hand, the
   general response of own rooted vines were better than those grafted on 5
   BB. Therefore, the use of one of V. berlandiery x V. rupestris hybrids
   may be abetter choice for viticulture under semiarid regions.},

Abstract = {This experiment was carried out to determine the percentage of internal
   connection between rootstock and scion in graft union with
   nondestructive and noninvasive MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) method
   and to follow performance status according to internal connection ratios
   of the grafted rooted vines after planting to vineyard field. Research
   was established in a factorial randomized block design and carried out
   with cvs. Merlot and Syrah grafted onto 110R rootstock and 4 different
   internal (MRI) connection levels in 3 replications. The percentages of
   grafted rooted vine internal determination by MRI by four sides
   (13.75\%) in graft union were found to be very low than others at the
   pre-planting stage. An increase in the internal connection ratio in the
   majority of the grafted rooted vines was determined after the vegetative
   growth phase. Therefore, the internal connection ratios of the graft
   union of rooted vines of cvs. Merlot and Syrah varieties showed a
   tendency to increase during the second year of development. Again in
   both cultivars, loss rate of grafted rooted vines showed a decreasing
   tendency depending on increase of internal connection ratio of graft
   union. As a result, in case of decrease of MRI costs, it is thought that
   grafted rooted vine producers may have the opportunity to supply better
   quality seedlings to vine growers using MRI techniques.},

Abstract = {The Puget Sound American Viticulture Area (AVA), located west of the
   Cascade Mountain Range in Washington State, is a large and uniquely
   situated area with diverse topography and mesoclimates. Given the young
   age of the AVA, little formal information exists on the appropriate
   rootstock-scion combination in wine grapes ( Vitis vinifera) for the
   region. This project reports on a series of rootstock trials from 2003
   to 2007, which evaluated the influence of `420A Millardet et de
   Grasset', `3309 Couderc', `101-14 Millardet et de Grasset' (all Vitis
   hybrids), and a self-rooted control on basic harvest metrics of the wine
   grape scion `Pinot noir clone 02A'. At the warmer site in Everson, WA,
   rootstocks had no effect on final juice harvest metrics measured by
   soluble solids, titratable acidity (TA), and pH. At the cooler site in
   Mount Vernon, WA, the use of rootstocks did not always influence soluble
   solids or pH but did reduce final harvest TA, a desired effect for the
   region that is typified by low sugar-high TA wines. Even with a
   reduction in TA in some rootstock-scion combinations, overall, TA
   remained at the upper end or above the range typically desired for many
   wine styles.},

Abstract = {A protocol is offered as a guideline for managers of rootstock mother
   grapevines, and as a potential research framework for to reduce
   infections by Grapevine Trunk Disease (GTD) pathogens in rootstock
   mother vines and cuttings. Latent infections by GTD pathogens in
   rootstock cuttings are a major source of the pathogens in grafted
   nursery vines and subsequently in new vineyards. The many pruning cuts
   made at the crowns of mother vines predispose them to infection which is
   transmitted to the new shoots via the xylem. Direct penetration by
   epiphytic inoculum on the bark of the shoots / canes can also occur.
   Mother vines with unprotected pruning wounds are typically heavily
   infected, particularly if they are not trellised. Availability of
   pruning wound treatments is limited in many countries. The spread of GTD
   pathogen inoculum can be reduced by avoiding sprinkler and flood
   irrigation, by trellising mother vines so that canopies are off the
   soil, and by spraying fungicides or painting wounds immediately after
   canes are harvested. Frequent trunk renewal aids in reducing inoculum.
   Cuts should be made to retain long internodes on the mother vines,
   cuttings should not contact the soil and pruning debris should be
   promptly destroyed. Cutting implements should be disinfested regularly
   and cuttings should be dipped in a registered fungicide or sterilant.
   Soaking cuttings increases fungal populations in the basal wounds and
   softens the bark, favouring penetration by pathogen inoculum. Dormant
   bench grafting in nurseries produces more GTD-symptomatic vines than
   field chip budding, so improved management for rootstock mother vines is
   more important where dormant cuttings are bench grafted. GTD
   epidemiology in source blocks is summarised, and best practice protocols
   for mother vine management and pre-grafting stages of propagation are
   suggested. Similar principles could be applied to scion mother vine
   management.},

Abstract = {Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are one of the most important groups of
   fungal diseases affecting grapevine plants worldwide. One of the main
   causes of GTDs infection occur during nursery plant production
   processes. The phytosanitary status was determined for 150 young
   grapevine plants (two varieties grafted onto different rootstocks) that
   were produced in three European nurseries. Some plants were analyzed
   upon submission, while others were assessed after up to 12 months growth
   in a greenhouse. Fungal species associated with GTDs were identified and
   characterized from the scions, graft unions, rootstocks, or roots. A
   total of 449 fungal isolates associated with GTDs were obtained, and 20
   species were identified by morphological characteristics and DNA
   analyses. Five species were involved in Botryosphaeria dieback, six in
   black foot disease, six in Diaporthe dieback, and three in Petri
   disease. Incidence of GTDs on grapevine plants was between 81 and 100\%,
   with different diseases varying between rootstocks and grapevine
   varieties. Isolates of other fungal genera not involved in the GTD
   complex were also detected, including Colletotrichum, Fusarium, and
   Rhizoctonia. The high presence of GTDs during nursery production of
   grapevine plants raises the need to implement effective control methods
   that could prevent the spread of these diseases to vineyards.},

Journal = {PLANT SCIENCE},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rootstocks play an important role in the cultivation of grapevines. In
   addition to the uptake and storage of nutrients, rootstocks and their
   root system affect the growth and metabolite composition of the berries.
   Nitrogen can be taken up in various forms, such as nitrate, ammonium or
   amino acids or even small peptides, and is of considerable importance in
   vigor control and in yield and berry quality. Amino acids in the must
   adjust fermentation kinetics, constitute a major source for yeast and
   affect vine metabolism. In the present study, two different experiments
   were undertaken; nitrate, ammonium, urea, arginine and glutamine at
   various doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 3.0 g N/plant) were used to fertilize (i)
   two hydroponically grown rootstock varieties (Ru140 and SO4) and (ii)
   grafted grapevines of Vitis vinifera L cv. Regent (rootstock SO4) grown
   in pots. Accumulation capabilities, generative growth and berry quality
   were examined. It can be assed that the preferred N form is
   rootstockvariety-dependent. We demonstrated that grapevines were able to
   take up nitrogen in the form of amino acids; (arginine to a greater
   extent than glutamine). Although, growth was reduced, nitrogen content
   and nitrate reductase activity were comparable for nitrate, ammonium and
   urea nutrition. In terms of berry quality, only minor differences
   between the N forms applied were identified. An economic optimum in
   terms of vine and berry quality was detected. Excessive amounts of
   nitrogen seemed to lead to the increased growth of green plant tissue.
   Berry yield increased with increasing nitrogen supply but slightly
   decreased at the highest dosage, whereas quality parameters such as must
   pH increased and the total acid concentration was reduced.},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {The grapevine phenology is dependent on several factors, such as
   genetics, soil characteristics, climate conditions, pests and diseases
   and vineyard cultural practices. Among these, grafting may have an
   effect on the scion behavior due to the influence of the rootstock.
   Therefore, an experiment was carried out for two years to determine the
   effect of rootstocks on Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) grapevine phenology,
   chilling and heat requirements. Treatments consisted of vines grafted on
   the rootstocks Rupestris du Lot, 101-14 Mgt, 3309 C, 420A Mgt, 5BB K,
   161-49 C, SO4, Solferino, 1103 P, 99 R, 110 R, Gravesac, Fercal,
   Dogridge and Isabel. Budbreak and flowering of the vines, veraison and
   maturity of the grapes were the phenological stages evaluated,
   determining the dates of each stage and the number of days between them.
   The chilling hours (Tbase= 10 degrees C) for budbreak and the heat
   summation required to ripen the grapes were also determined. The results
   showed that the dates of each phenological stage varied according to the
   year and the rootstock. The average of two years showed that CS/3309 C,
   CS/161-49 C and CS/101-14 Mgt sprouted earlier and CS/Dogridge later.
   Grape maturity was earlier on seven CS/rootstocks, where CS/101-14 Mgt
   and CS/Rupestiis du Lot ripened first and CS/Isabel, CS/5BB K and CS/SO4
   later. The average intervals between the stages of CS/rootstocks were
   (in days), 46.8 +/- 3.0 (budbreak-flowering), 64.3 +/- 2.1
   (flowering-veraison), 54.6 +/- 6.1 (veraison-maturity) and 165.7 +/- 7.4
   (budbreak-maturity). In 1998, 615.9 +/- 8.0 chill hours were needed to
   achieve 50\% budbreak and in 1999, 870.6 +/- 6.5 chill hours. where
   CS/Dogridge required the highest chilling to break dormancy. In order to
   ripen the grapes, the heat requirement from budbreak to maturity was
   1573.4 +/- 43.0 degrees C in 1998/1999 and 1599.4 +/- 25.5 degrees C in
   1999/2000, and the juice total soluble solids values were 19.1 and 18.1
   degrees Brix, respectively. Although the heat summation of the second
   cycle was 1.65\% higher, the total soluble solids were lower due to the
   rainfall that was much higher during its grape ripening period.},

Abstract = {Aims: Rootstocks provide protection against soil-borne pests and are a
   powerful tool to manipulate growth, fruit composition and wine-quality
   attributes. The present study aimed to assess the consistency of
   rootstock effects on the growth and fruit composition of scion varieties
   and identify scion x rootstock interactions.
   Methods and results: Vine performance and fruit composition of
   hot-climate, drip-irrigated, spur-pruned Chardonnay, Cabernet-Sauvignon
   and Shiraz, grafted on seven rootstocks, was assessed over five seasons
   from 2013 to 2017. Rootstocks included Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen and 140
   Ruggeri and four promising selections from the CSIRO rootstock
   development programme. Vines were trained as quadrilateral cordons on a
   two-wire vertical trellis of height 1.8 m and 3.0 m row x 1.8 m vine
   spacing, and irrigated with 5.5-6.0 ML/ha of water each season. The
   study was conducted with mature vines, established in 2006, as a
   randomised block design with five replicates. There were significant
   effects of both variety and rootstock on yield, number of bunches, bunch
   weight, berry weight (scion only), berries per bunch, pruning weight and
   the Ravaz Index (yield/pruning weight). Despite identical management
   practices, there were large differences between scion varieties in key
   growth characteristics across rootstocks. Chardonnay produced a high
   yield (mean 25.2 kg/vine) with low pruning weight (2.3 kg/vine) and a
   high mean Ravaz Index value of 12.1. Shiraz had the highest yield (27.4
   kg/vine) with high pruning weight (5.1 kg/vine) and a Ravaz Index of
   6.3. Cabernet-Sauvignon had the lowest yield (15.9 kg/vine) and highest
   pruning weight (6.6 kg/vine) and a very low Ravaz Index value of 3.0.
   Effects of rootstock on growth characteristics were smaller than the
   effects of variety, with mean yields ranging from 19.5 to 25.9 kg/vine,
   pruning weights ranging from 3.24 to 6.13 kg/vine and mean Ravaz Index
   values ranging from 5.54 to 8.63. Each variety was harvested when the
   mean total soluble solids reached 25.0 degrees Brix. Significant effects
   of variety and rootstock on fruit composition, included pH, titratable
   acidity (scion only), malate, tartrate (scion only), yeast assimilable
   nitrogen (YAN); and for the red varieties, total anthocyanins (scion
   only) and phenolic substances (scion only). Significant interactions
   between scion variety and rootstocks were found for yield, number of
   bunches, berry weight, pruning weight and Ravaz Index. The effect of
   rootstock on bunch weight and berries per bunch was consistent across
   scions. Significant scion x rootstock interactions were also found for
   pH and YAN. For each variety, significant effects of rootstock on fruit
   composition were linked to growth characteristics. However, these
   relationships, based on correlation analyses, varied for each scion.
   Conclusions: The study has shown that growth characteristics and fruit
   composition of the major varieties was not consistent across seven
   rootstock genotypes, as significant scion x rootstock interactions were
   determined. Hence, different rootstocks may be required for each variety
   to optimise scion performance and fruit composition. The study has also
   shown that the new CSIRO rootstock selections, covering a range of
   vigour classifications, may be useful alternatives to those currently in
   use by industry.
   Significance and impact of the study: The study has shown that the
   performance of scion varieties, and to a lesser degree the fruit
   composition, is dependent on rootstock choice. The inherent vigour of
   the scion variety must be considered in rootstock selection.
   Furthermore, individual scion/rootstock combinations may require
   specific irrigation, pruning or canopy management to achieve vine
   balance and optimise fruit and wine composition.},

Title = {Characterisation of different GLRaV-3 variant infections by determining
   virus concentration ratios and miRNA expression profiles},
Journal = {VITIS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {79-86},
Abstract = {Grapevine leafroll disease (GLD) is present in all grape-growing regions
   of the world and is considered the most significant grapevine viral
   disease. Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) is considered
   the primary cause of GLD and in South African vineyards five genetic
   variant groups (I, II, III, VI and VII) have been confirmed. Biological
   distinctions between GLRaV-3 variants have not been fully validated. By
   characterising virus concentration and stress-responsive microRNA
   expression in GLRaV-3 infected plants, this study aimed to glean a
   better understanding of the possible biological distinctions between
   GLRaV-3 variants. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was utilised
   for virus concentration ratio (VCR) determination and miRNA quantitation
   in GLRaV-3 positive and negative grapevines grown under greenhouse and
   field conditions. This study found statistically significant differences
   in VCRs in plants singly infected with different GLRaV-3 variants.
   Interestingly, no difference in mean VCRs were observed between data
   sets, despite notable differences in plant age, duration of GLRaV-3
   infection, scion/rootstock combination and growing conditions. Several
   miRNAs showed statistically significant expression modulation between
   infected and healthy samples. miRNA expression between data sets varied
   substantially and a greater overall miRNA response was observed in
   plants with more established GLRaV-3 infections. The lack of significant
   differences in mean VCRs between data sets, coupled with the consistent
   modulation of certain miRNAs in plants that have likely been infected
   for longer is a promising result. This finding could indicate that
   successful inhibition of further virus replication by plant defence
   mechanisms occurred, and that these miRNAs are implicated in this
   response.},

Title = {Quality and antioxidant potential of `BRS clara' and `Arizul' grapes
   influenced by rootstocks in a tropical region},
Journal = {CIENCIA E AGROTECNOLOGIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Abstract = {Seedless table grapes cultivars have been studied in the Sub-middle
   region of sao Francisco Valley at northeast Brazil. For that region, it
   is important to identify cultivars with productive potential, better
   quality and efficiency, minimizing the expenses in terms of inputs and
   workforce, when compared to traditional cultivars. Specifically, the
   objective of this study was to determine the influence of different
   rootstocks on the quality and on the antioxidant potential of BRS Clara
   and Arizul table grapes cultivars of two production cydes. The
   experimental area belongs to the Experimental Field of Bebedouro/Embrapa
   Semiarido, located in the sub-middle region of Sao Francisco Valley, in
   Petrolina - PE, northeast Brazil. Both BRS Clara and Arizul cultivars
   were analyzed individually using IAC 313, IAC 572, IAC 766, SO4, Paulsen
   1103 and Harmony rootstocks, during production cycles from October/2016
   to February/2017 and from March/2007 to June/2017. The experimental
   design was planned in randomized blocks, in a 2 (production cycle) x 6
   (rootstock) factorial, with three replications each. More favorable
   conditions to quality for `BRS Clara' grapes, as evidenced by higher
   berry mass, lower soluble solids (SS)/titratable acidity (TA) ratio and
   higher antioxidant activity, were observed after the March-June, 2017
   harvest, especially from scions grafted onto IAC 572, SO4 and Harmony.
   The Arizul cultivar was characterized by better quality after the
   March-July, 2017 harvest, showing higher berry mass, lower acidity and
   lower SS/TA ratio and a better color mainly in SO4 and Harmony
   rootstocks. Therefore, an appropriate rootstock enhances the quality of
   the grapes.},

Abstract = {The rootstock effect on grapevine yield components, grape must and wine
   composition and wine sensory characteristics were evaluated in previous
   studies. This experiment carried out over five years had the objective
   to determine the effect of the rootstock on the evolution of variables
   related to sugar and acidity contents of the juice during grape
   ripening. The treatments consisted of Cabernet Sauvignon grapevine
   grafted on rootstocks such as Rupestris du Lot, 101-14 Mgt, 3309 C, 420A
   Mgt, 5BB K, 161-49 C, SO4, Solferino, 1103 P, 99 R, 110 R, Gravesac,
   Fercal, Dogridge and Isabel. The berries were sampled during the grape
   ripening period, on nine dates during the summer of each year. Taken to
   the laboratory, they were hand crushed and the juice was centrifuged to
   separate the solid and liquid phase, where the supernatant was then used
   for physicochemical analyses. The data were submitted to Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) and polynomial regression analysis. The main
   results show that, at grape maturity, the PCA discriminated mainly the
   juices of CS/101-14 Mgt, CS/SO4 and CS/Gravesac, which had high density,
   total soluble solids, total soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio and
   pH, and CS/Dogridge and CS/Fercal, which had high titratable acidity.
   The density, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total soluble
   solids/titratable acidity ratio increased as grape ripened, but the
   titratable acidity decreased. However, the increase or decrease rates
   were lower at the end of the grape ripening cycle according to the
   variable, and the total soluble solids having the highest increase
   (116.3\%) and the titratable acidity the highest decrease (68.3\%).},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {A survey was carried out in 22 European and some non-European
   Mediterranean countries in 2015 and 2016, to gain insights into the main
   fungal grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) in Europe. Information was
   obtained from 105 viticulture regions, representing approx. four million
   ha of vineyards. Vintage and table wines are the main industry products,
   followed by nursery plants and table grapes. Diverse scion cultivars are
   grown, with 13 cultivars providing 50\% of survey respondent production,
   and Riesling Italico, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot
   predominating. The five most used rootstocks are SO4, 110R, K5BB, 41B
   and 1103P, together representing about 50\% of survey respondent
   production. Despite the diversity of grapevine training, Guyot and
   cordon remain the most widespread methods, and grapevines are mainly
   hand-pruned. The use of pneumatic shears and mechanical pruning is
   becoming more common in some countries. The survey questionnaire
   proposed a simplified set of symptoms or diseases occurring in mature
   vineyards {[}apoplexy, esca complex leaf symptoms (including Grapevine
   Leaf Stripe Disease, GLSD), dead cordon, Eutypa related dieback,
   Botryosphaeria or unidentified agent dieback, Phomopsis cane and leaf
   spot]. Apoplexy and esca/GLSD, defining the esca complex, were the most
   frequent and increasing syndromes in almost all countries, except Israel
   and the United Kingdom, where these diseases are not present or not
   recorded in the survey. Dead cordon and Phomopsis cane and leaf spot
   were mentioned as occurring in a large number of regions but not
   frequently. Within individual countries, the profile of GTDs varied
   according to the region, and to pedo-climatic and production conditions.
   GTDs on young vines were uncommon, but remain a subject of concern in
   some of European countries with large nursery production. This overview
   on spread and relevance of GTDs in Europe and related aspects will be a
   useful starting point for policy makers and for collaborative research
   on factors contributing to the increasing disease incidence of GTDs.},

Abstract = {Cultivars of grapevine are commonly grafted onto rootstocks to improve
   resistance against biotic and abiotic stress, however, it is not clear
   whether known differences in hydraulic traits are conferred from
   rootstocks to a common scion. We recently found that Vitis riparia and
   Vitis champinii differed in drought-induced embolism susceptibility and
   repair, which was related to differences in root pressure generation
   after rewatering (Knipfer et al. 2015). In the present study, we tested
   whether these and other physiological responses to drought are conferred
   to a common V. vinifera scion (Cabernet Sauvignon) grafted on V. riparia
   and V. champinii rootstocks. We measured xylem embolism formation/repair
   using in vivo microCT imaging, which was accompanied with analysis of
   leaf gas exchange, osmotic adjustment and root pressure. Our data
   indicate that differences in scion physiological behaviour for both
   rootstock combinations were negligible, suggesting that the sensitivity
   of Cabernet Sauvignon scion to xylem embolism formation/repair, leaf gas
   exchange and osmotic adjustment is unaffected by either V. riparia or V.
   champinii rootstock in response to drought stress.},

Abstract = {The interaction among rootstock, scion and environment may induce
   different responses to the grapevine physiology and consequently to the
   grape and wine composition. The vineyards of Serra Gaucha, Brazil, are
   established in soils that may have different physicochemical attributes.
   Furthermore, the grapevines are grafted on a wide diversity of

   malolactic fermentations were over, the wine analyses were performed on
   twentyfive variables related to alcohol, acidity, dry extract,

   a few by the interaction between rootstock and year. The rootstock
   effect was observed mainly on variables related to alcohol, acidity and
   ashes. Results show that the CS/101-14 Mgt wine had higher alcohol
   content than CS/Dogridge and CS/Isabel wines, which was probably due to
   the 101-14 Mgt rootstock favoring an early grape ripening. However,
   higher pH values were observed in the CS/Rupestrisdu Lot, CS/5BB K and
   CS/Gravesac than CS/420A Mgt, CS/110 R and CS/Isabel wines. These
   results show that there is a diversity of rootstocks that can be used by
   the growers due to the Cabernet Sauvignon wine composition similarities.},

Abstract = {With a farm gate value in 2016 of US\$68 billion, grapes are the world's
   third most valuable horticultural crop (after potatoes and tomatoes).
   Cultivation of grapes for fruit and wine began at least 7000 years ago
   in the Near East, and over the millennia, thousands of cultivars have
   been developed and selected for particular purposes. Nowadays, grapes
   are grown all around the world, but mainly in places having a temperate,
   Mediterranean-style climate, and they are used to produce diverse
   consumer products including wine, table grapes, raisins, grape juice
   concentrate and distillate for various industrial uses as well as making
   fortified wine and brandy. The cultivars of grapes used to make these
   diverse products are likewise diverse, but a relatively small number
   account for the vast majority of production in each major category.
   Predominantly, European V. vinifera scions are grown on rootstock from
   phylloxera-resistant Native American species. Particular cultivars are
   valuable to farmers in particular applications for their agronomic
   traits and fruit-quality traits, which together determine the value of
   the crop and the cost of producing it. These values can be conditioned
   by consumer preferences for attributes of the production process and by
   government policies including trade taxes, alcohol excise taxes, and
   regulations over production practices or limiting yields. Evolving
   demands for traits create demands for work by viticulturists and other
   scientists to understand the grape genome and work with it.},

Abstract = {Pest and disease pressures have traditionally driven the use of
   grapevine rootstocks. However, with competing demands on limited water
   resources and changing climate conditions, the water available for
   agriculture will likely continue to diminish. This inevitability has
   resulted in an increased interest in grape rootstock effects on scion
   growth, specifically yield components, as a function of parentage and in
   terms of drought tolerance. It has also spurred efforts to breed new
   rootstocks with combined pest, disease, and abiotic stress resistance.
   Field studies examining rootstock effect on scion growth and development
   have been inconsistent due to complications associated with varying soil
   types and weather factors unique to each site. Other factors tend to
   vary from site to site including trellising systems, scion cultivar
   selection and management practices, each of which also has a role in
   determining vine phenology. Due to these issues, rootstock trial data is
   often presented on a site-by-site basis with the objective of
   determining if a specific rootstock tends to yield more or less than
   other rootstocks on a given site. Although inherently limited by the
   aforementioned challenges, rootstock trails are arguably one of the best
   methods of providing insight into rootstock performance and scion
   interactions. The Wolpert rootstock trails in California were one of the
   more comprehensive efforts to understand and classify rootstock
   performance as a function of site. General trends in performance were
   observed as a function of rootstock selection with regard to yield and
   pruning weights.},

Abstract = {Grapevine decline and dieback is a serious problem for grape production
   in southern Brazil. It is characterized by a set of symptoms that lead
   to the weakening and death of affected plants. The main causes are a
   root scale, the ground-pearl (Eurhizococcus brasiliensis), associated
   with soil fungi (Cylindrocarpon, Fusarium, Phaeacrimonium and others),
   and high-clay-content soils. Apparently, the root wounds caused by
   ground-pearl under poorly aerated soil conditions allow the entrance of
   root decay fungi, resulting in plant death. The creation of grape
   rootstocks resistant to root decay fungi is one objective of the grape
   breeding program at Epagri, the Agricultural Research Enterprise of
   Santa Catarina State, Brazil. The first step was the identification of
   resistance sources. In rootstock trials carried out in areas where high
   mortality rates were previously observed, all traditional rootstocks
   were highly susceptible. Vitis caribaea hybrids showed a high level of
   resistance but also some defects, such as excessive vigor and absence of
   winter dormancy. Some genotypes of Vitis shuttleworthii and Vitis
   palmata, originating from the waterlogged soil conditions of the
   Everglades (Florida, USA), also showed a high level of resistance.
   However, the performance of these genotypes and their descendants under
   dry soil conditions was very poor, and more generations of crossing will
   be necessary to eliminate undesirable characters. The most promising
   breeding lines resulted from self pollination of the rootstock IAC 572
   (V. caribaea x 101-14Mgt). The selection process started from 840
   seedlings and resulted in 23 selections that showed no symptoms of vine
   decline at three different sites. These selections are being evaluated
   now for productivity and fruit quality in rootstock trials with
   different scion cultivars.},

Abstract = {In grafted grapevines, the growth potential (vigor) of the scion results
   from the three-way interaction between the environment, the scion
   genotype, and the rootstock genotype. Since nitrogen (N) availability is
   a major driver of grapevine growth, understanding N metabolism
   regulation by both grafted partners could lead to the development of new
   practices aimed at controlling plant vigor. We are developing a model
   system to study N regulation by evaluating the responses to N supply
   among six scion/rootstock (S/R) combinations with known differences in
   vigor for both partners. The primary objective is to understand the
   influence of scion and rootstock separately on growth parameters and
   resource allocation. We measured stem growth during two seasons and
   biomass, carbon (C) and N allocation patterns in tissues (leaves, stem,
   trunk and roots) of four plants at the end of the first season.
   Preliminary results supported the expected vigor behavior of the three
   `Pinot noir' scions grafted to the same rootstock. This was not true for
   the four rootstocks grafted to the same scion. High N treatment
   increases C and N allocation in perennial plant parts. During the second
   year, N-starvation treatment of the same plants revealed differences in
   the capacity of rootstocks to remobilize reserves to sustain scion
   growth. This experiment is the first step in a broad range project that
   will evaluate the interaction response of scions and rootstocks to N
   supply.},

Abstract = {In viticulture, grafting is used to facilitate grapevine cultivation in
   soils infected with phylloxera, a soil-dwelling insect pest introduced
   to Europe from America at the end of the 19th century. Successful
   grafting of plants is a complex biochemical and structural process that
   begins with an initial wound response, followed by callus formation and
   the establishment of a functional vascular system between the two
   grafting partners. Despite the importance of the scion-rootstock
   interface in viticulture, we know little of the processes involved in
   forming a successful graft union. Developments at the scion-rootstock
   interface of grapevine have been studied using a variety of techniques.
   Morphological developments have been studied using microscopy techniques
   and X-ray computed tomography, and xylem connectivity has been assessed
   by using a high- and low-pressure flow meter. Microarrays have been used
   to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the wood and
   graft interface tissues of homo-grafts (the same genotype grafted
   together) and at the graft interface between different scion-rootstock
   combinations (hetero-grafts). Primary and secondary metabolite profiling

Abstract = {As the climate changes, genetic adaptation of crops to abiotic stresses
   is an increasingly important issue, especially for a perennial crops of
   high economic value such as grapevine. Given the numerous environments
   where this plant can be found, and the huge intra- and interspecific
   diversity, we can assume that grapevine genomes contain many alleles
   that could be exploited to ensure the sustainability of viticulture. The
   challenge is to identify these alleles and to understand how they can be
   used to manipulate phenotypes. The diversity of abiotic constraints
   (thermal stress, drought, salinity, mineral deficiency, etc.) and their
   timing, duration, and intensity must be taken into account. The traits
   that underlie plant adaptation and the sensitive stages of development
   should be clearly defined. Targeted traits are often complex and under
   the control of various genetic mechanisms. Over the past 10 years, there
   have been numerous achievements in grapevine research such as genome
   sequencing, phenotyping improvement, genetics, functional
   characterization of genes, and modeling. Thanks to new knowledge and
   technologies, our understanding of grapevine adaptation to abiotic
   stresses has improved and can now be used to screen existing germplasms
   or to breed new genotypes. An overview of the main programs performed

Abstract = {Regulation of root system growth and architecture is an adaptive
   mechanism evolved by plants to cope with variable nitrogen availability
   in the soil. In grafted plants, this process depends on intrinsic
   properties of the rootstock as well as long-distance signaling between
   each partner of the graft (scion and rootstock) and contributes to the
   fitness of the whole plant. We show here that two grapevine rootstock
   genotypes known to differentially control scion growth have developed
   two distinct root development strategies to optimize nutrient uptake in
   response to nitrogen availability. The rootstock `1103 Paulsen'
   conferring high vigor developed a deeper root system and a larger number
   of lateral roots than `Riparia Gloire de Montpellier' (RGM), a rootstock
   that confers low vigor, whatever the nitrogen concentration in the
   culture medium. RGM cuttings grew surface roots and developed lateral
   roots only with low nitrogen supply. This developmental pattern suggests
   that RGM promotes lateral root production when nitrogen content is
   limiting to increase its prospecting area for the uptake of nitrogen
   resources. Gene expression profiling revealed interesting patterns and
   differences between the two studied rootstocks, particularly concerning
   hormone signaling.},

Title = {Trans-Graft Protection Against Pierce's Disease Mediated by Transgenic
   Grapevine Rootstocks},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {A field study showed that transgenic grapevine rootstocks can provide
   trans-graft-mediated protection to a wild type scion against Pierce's
   disease (PD) development. We individually field-tested two distinct
   strategies. The first expressed a chimeric antimicrobial protein (CAP)
   that targeted the functionality of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) surface
   of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), the causative agent of PD. The second
   expressed a plant polygalacturonase inhibitory protein (PGIP) that
   prevents PD by inhibiting breakdown of pectin present in primary cell
   walls. Both proteins are secreted to the apoplast and then into the
   xylem, where they migrate past the graft union, transiting into the
   xylem of the grafted scion. Transgenic Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson
   Seedless (TS) expressing ether CAP or PGIP were tested in the greenhouse
   and those lines that showed resistance to PD were grafted with wild type
   TS scions. Grafted grapevines were introduced into the field and tested
   over 7 years. Here we present data on the field evaluation of
   trans-graft protection using four CAP and four PGIP independent
   rootstock lines, compared to an untransformed rootstock. There was 30 to
   95\% reduction in vine mortality among CAP-and PGIP-expressing lines
   after three successive yearly infections with virulent Xf. Shoot tissues
   grafted to either CAP or PGIP transgenic rootstocks supported lower
   pathogen titers and showed fewer disease symptoms. Grafted plants on
   transgenic rootstocks also had more spring bud break following
   infection, more shoots, and more vigorous growth compared to those
   grafted to wild type rootstocks. No yield penalty was observed in the
   transgenic lines and some PGIP-expressing vines had enhanced yield
   potential. Trans-graft protection is an efficient way to protect grape
   scions against PD while preserving their valuable varietal genotypes and
   clonal properties.},

Title = {Transcriptomic response is more sensitive to water deficit in shoots
   than roots of Vitis riparia (Michx.)},
Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {Background: Drought is an important constraint on grapevine
   sustainability. Vitis riparia, widely used in rootstock and scion
   breeding, has been studied in isolated leaf drying response studies;
   however, it is essential to identify key root and shoot water deficit
   signaling traits in intact plants. This information will aid improved
   scion and rootstock selection and management practices in grapevine.
   RNAseq data were generated from V. riparia roots and shoots under water
   deficit and well-watered conditions to determine root signaling and
   shoot responses to water deficit.
   Results: Shoot elongation, photosynthetic rate, and stomatal conductance
   were significantly reduced in water deficit (WD) treated than in
   well-watered grapevines. RNAseq analysis indicated greater
   transcriptional differences in shoots than in roots under WD, with 6925
   and 1395 genes differentially expressed, respectively (q-value <0.05).
   There were 50 and 25 VitisNet pathways significantly enriched in WD
   relative to well-watered treatments in grapevine shoots and roots,
   respectively. The ABA biosynthesis genes beta-carotene hydroxylase,
   zeaxanthin epoxidase, and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases were
   up-regulated in WD root and WD shoot. A positive enrichment of ABA
   biosynthesis genes and signaling pathways in WD grapevine roots
   indicated enhanced root signaling to the shoot. An increased frequency
   of differentially expressed reactive oxygen species scavenging (ROS)
   genes were found in the WD shoot. Analyses of hormone signaling genes
   indicated a strong ABA, auxin, and ethylene network and an ABA,
   cytokinin, and circadian rhythm network in both WD shoot and WD root.
   Conclusions: This work supports previous findings in detached leaf
   studies suggesting ABA-responsive binding factor 2 (ABF2) is a central
   regulator in ABA signaling in the WD shoot. Likewise, ABF2 may have a
   key role in V. riparia WD shoot and WD root. A role for ABF3 was
   indicated only in WD root. WD shoot and WD root hormone expression
   analysis identified strong ABA, auxin, ethylene, cytokinin, and
   circadian rhythm signaling networks. These results present the first
   ABA, cytokinin, and circadian rhythm signaling network in roots under
   water deficit. These networks point to organ specific regulators that
   should be explored to further define the communication network from soil
   to shoot.},

Volume = {246},

Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {The lack of graft success is a problem that causes economic loss to
   nursery growers and wine growers, especially because it is often
   expressed when the vineyard is already established. Grafting is a
   complex phenomenon, involving anatomical, physiological, biochemical and
   molecular interactions between the scion and the rootstock. For this
   reason, the lack of graft success is a complex problem to study.
   However, it is believed that through a joint analysis of the different
   mechanisms of graft success, one can advance more quickly in the
   knowledge of this phenomenon. Despite the scarce information available
   on the role of phenolic compounds in Vitis grafts, an analytical method
   was developed and validated for phenolic compounds quantification in
   vine graft tissues reviling some chemical markers for the cv. `Syrah'
   with 11OR and SO4 rootstocks. This work aims to determine, among
   phenolic acids and two flavanols, the chemical markers of graft
   compatibility between scions from two clones of cv. `Touriga Nacional'
   (TN 21 and TN 112) and the rootstock 110R. For this purpose, extracts of
   grafting tissues were prepared at three different locations (above,
   below and at the grafting union), and were analyzed in three different
   stages of the grafting cycle. From all sections analyzed, the graft
   union tissue is the one to discriminate better the two combinations.
   Gallic acid, catechin and sinapic acid were found in higher amount at
   graft union in the less compatible combination later in graft
   development. Furthermore, the chlorogenic acid had a higher content in
   the more compatible combination at the early stage when compared to the
   less compatible graft.},

Title = {Impact of grapevine age on water status and productivity of Vitis

Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Grapevines are perennial plants that can display remarkable longevity.
   It is often thought that some of their characteristics evolve in a
   positive way as they grow older, such as having a higher tolerance to
   water deficit and an improved balance between vegetative and
   reproductive growth. However, only a few studies have been conducted so
   far on the possible effects of age on vine productivity and water
   status.
   An experimental vineyard was designed in the German Rheingau region to
   compare vines of identical planting material planted at three different
   times. The vineyard was established in 1971 with Vitis vinifera (L.) cv.
   Riesling vines (clone Gm 239-17) grafted on 5C Teleki and trained in
   double Guyot and cordon in alternating rows. In 1995 and 2012, rows of
   both training systems were uprooted and replanted with the same
   scion/rootstock combination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   impact of vine age on several physiological and reproductive parameters.
   Vines planted in 2012 were generally more sensitive to water deficit
   than vines planted in 1995 and 1971, although this depended on the
   amount of precipitations during the growing season. A supporting trial
   was carried to create more intense drought conditions by deploying a
   plastic mulch around selected vines during rain events. Young vines were
   most affected by the treatment, suggesting that their lower trolerance
   to water deficit might be due to a shallower root system. Vines planted
   in 1995 and 1971 displayed similar response to water deficit. Canopy
   architecture, cluster parameters and vine balance components including
   pruning weight and yield were different for the youngest vines until the
   fifth year after planting due to their lower cropping capacity. Even
   though the observed yield and pruning weight per meter were lower for
   grapevines planted in 1971 than those planted in 1995, these variables
   were similar across the two age groups when missing vines were taken
   into account. Wood diseases were identified as the main factor behind
   the decline of old vines. The study suggests that the management of wood
   diseases is a key component in improving vineyard longevity, and that
   the conservation of grape yield and technological maturity parameters
   for vineyards in similar environmental conditions is indeed possible
   over the long term.},

   time-consuming process. In addition, the mixed effects of grapevine
   water status and scion-rootstock interactions on grapevine productivity
   are not always linear. Despite the potential opportunity of applying
   remote sensing and machine learning techniques to predict plant traits,
   there are still limitations to previously studied techniques for vine
   productivity due to the complexity of the system not being adequately
   modeled. During the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons, hyperspectral
   reflectance spectra were collected using a handheld spectroradiometer in
   a vineyard designed to investigate the effects of irrigation level (0\%,
   50\%, and 100\%) and rootstocks (1103 Paulsen, 3309 Couderc, SO4 and
   Chambourcin) on vine productivity. To assess vine productivity, it is
   necessary to measure factors related to fruit ripeness and not just
   yield, as an over cropped vine may produce high-yield but poor-quality
   fruit. Therefore, yield, Total Soluble Solids (TSS), Titratable Acidity
   (TA) and the ratio TSS/TA (maturation index, IMAD) were measured. A
   total of 20 vegetation indices were calculated from hyperspectral data
   and used as input for predictive model calibration. Prediction
   performance of linear/nonlinear multiple regression methods and Weighted
   Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (WRELM) were compared with our
   newly developed WRELM-TanhRe. The developed method is based on two
   activation functions: hyperbolic tangent (Tanh) and rectified linear
   unit (ReLU). The results revealed that WRELM and WRELM-TanhRe
   outperformed the widely used multiple regression methods when model
   performance was tested with an independent validation dataset.
   WRELM-TanhRe produced the highest prediction accuracy for all the berry
   yield and quality parameters (R-2 of 0.522-0.682 and RMSE of 2-15\%),
   except for TA, which was predicted best with WRELM (R-2 of 0.545 and
   RMSE of 6\%). The results demonstrate the value of combining
   hyperspectral remote sensing and machine learning methods for improving
   of berry yield and quality prediction.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Rootstocks affect vegetative and reproductive parameters of
   the scion. However, limited knowledge exists on the effects of the
   adoption of a specific rootstock on grape and wine phenolic composition,
   which contribute to certain sensory attributes such as color, body and
   astringency of wine. These compounds are mainly affected by the variety,
   viticultural management and rootstock. The aim of this work was to study
   the influence of eight rootstocks on grape anthocyanin content, skin and
   seed proanthocyanidins and wine chromatic characteristics obtained from
   Merlot vines.
   RESULTS Grapevines grafted onto SO4 rootstock, in general, presented a
   higher concentration of total proanthocyanidins in skins and seeds
   compared to the rest of the rootstocks, whereas grapevines grafted onto
   Gravesac presented a lower concentration of proanthocyanidins in skins
   and seeds. These differences were found in the wines developed from
   grapevines grafted onto SO4. Wines from grapevines grafted onto SO4, 140
   Ruggeri, Gravesac and 4453 M rootstocks presented, in general, better
   chromatic characteristics and a higher anthocyanin and tannin content
   than the rest of the samples.
   CONCLUSION This work gives additional information concerning the
   influence of rootstock on grape and wine phenolic composition. (c) 2018

Title = {Rootstock effects on scion phenotypes in a `Chambourcin' experimental
   vineyard},
Journal = {HORTICULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Understanding how root systems modulate shoot system phenotypes is a
   fundamental question in plant biology and will be useful in developing
   resilient agricultural crops. Grafting is a common horticultural
   practice that joins the roots (rootstock) of one plant to the shoot
   (scion) of another, providing an excellent method for investigating how
   these two organ systems affect each other. In this study, we used the
   French-American hybrid grapevine `Chambourcin' (Vitis L.) as a model to
   explore the rootstock-scion relationship. We examined leaf shape, ion
   concentrations, and gene expression in `Chambourcin' grown ungrafted as
   well as grafted to three different rootstocks ('SO4', `1103P' and
   `3309C') across 2 years and three different irrigation treatments. We
   found that a significant amount of the variation in leaf shape could be
   explained by the interaction between rootstock and irrigation. For ion
   concentrations, the primary source of variation identified was the
   position of a leaf in a shoot, although rootstock and rootstock by
   irrigation interaction also explained a significant amount of variation
   for most ions. Lastly, we found rootstock-specific patterns of gene
   expression in grafted plants when compared to ungrafted vines. Thus, our
   work reveals the subtle and complex effect of grafting on `Chambourcin'
   leaf morphology, ionomics, and gene expression.},

Title = {Wood and roots of major grapevine cultivars and rootstocks: A

Abstract = {Introduction Grapevine wood and roots are by-products obtained during
   vineyard management. This plentiful biomass is known to be rich in
   stilbenes and can be used as a source of high-value compounds as well as
   active natural extracts. However, the stilbenes in grapevine wood and
   roots from different cultivars and rootstocks remain to be
   characterized. Objective The present study investigated the stilbene
   content of eight major Vitis vinifera cultivars and six different
   rootstocks. In addition, the distribution of stilbenes was established
   for each of seven parts into which the plants were sub-divided.
   Methodology For stilbene characterization and quantification purposes,
   an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-diode array
   detector-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS) analysis of different
   samples was carried out. Moreover, structural data of stilbenes was
   unambiguously studied by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.
   Results Whatever the cultivar/rootstock combination, stilbenes were
   found to be oligomerized from the aerial part to the root system.
   Furthermore, stilbene content varied widely depending on the cultivars
   and rootstocks. For instance, the cultivars Merlot, Tannat and Gamay
   noir were the richest in stilbenes while the rootstocks Gravesac, Fercal
   and 3390C contained the highest amounts. Conclusion These findings
   provide insight into the knowledge that major grapevine cultivars and
   rootstocks can be used as a potential source of complex stilbenes.},

Title = {Grape Rootstock Response to Salinity, Water and Combined Salinity and
   Water Stresses},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Diminishing availability of non-saline water in arid and semiarid
   regions is of concern to all irrigated agricultural producers, including
   wine and grape producers. Grapes are not a salt tolerant crop and
   producers often face the choice of either limiting fresh water
   application, using alternative saline waters or a combination of both.
   We examined the salt tolerance and effect of restricted water
   application on three purported salt tolerant rootstocks grafted to
   Cabernet Sauvignon scion in a 4-year replicated field experiment. ANOVA
   indicated significant effects of salinity water stress and rootstock on
   fruit yields. The 140 Ruggeri scion was the top producer across all
   treatments including control, followed by Salt Creek, with St. George
   significantly less productive than 140 Ruggeri across all treatments. In
   terms of salt tolerance, Salt Creek and 140 Ruggeri were not
   statistically different but St. George was significantly less tolerant
   than Salt Creek. In terms of drought tolerance (relative yield), there
   were no statistical differences among rootstocks. Soil salinity profiles
   and soil moisture sensors indicated reduced water consumption under high
   salinity, thus no matric stress under 60\% of optimal water application
   when high salt stress was present. The multiplicative stress model where
   salt and water stress are individually evaluated did not satisfactorily
   predict yield under combined salinity and reduced water application,
   likely due to decreased water consumption under saline conditions. Short
   term (one year) experiments underestimate salt damage to grape vines as
   salt tolerance decreased over the 4-year experiment.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Main conclusionHeat and water stresses, individually or combined, affect
   both the plant (development, physiology, and production) and the
   pathogens (growth, morphology, dissemination, distribution, and
   virulence). The grapevine response to combined abiotic and biotic
   stresses is complex and cannot be inferred from the response to each
   single stress. Several factors might impact the response and the
   recovery of the grapevine, such as the intensity, duration, and timing
   of the stresses. In the heat/water stressGTDsgrapevine interaction, the
   nature of the pathogens, and the host, i.e., the nature of the
   rootstock, the cultivar and the clone, has a great importance. This
   review highlights the lack of studies investigating the response to
   combined stresses, in particular molecular studies, and the misreading
   of the relationship between rootstock and scion in the relationship
   GTDs/abiotic stresses.Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are one of the
   biggest threats to vineyard sustainability in the next 30years. Although
   many treatments and practices are used to manage GTDs, there has been an
   increase in the prevalence of these diseases due to several factors such
   as vineyard intensification, aging vineyards, or nursery practices. The
   ban of efficient treatments, i.e., sodium arsenite, carbendazim, and
   benomyl, in the early 2000s may be partly responsible for the fast
   spread of these diseases. However, GTD-associated fungi can act as
   endophytes for several years on, or inside the vine until the appearance
   of the first symptoms. This prompted several researchers to hypothesise
   that abiotic conditions, especially thermal and water stresses, were
   involved in the initiation of GTD symptoms. Unfortunately, the frequency
   of these abiotic conditions occurring is likely to increase according to
   the recent consensus scenario of climate change, especially in
   wine-growing areas. In this article, following a review on the impact of
   combined thermal and water stresses on grapevine physiology, we will
   examine (1) how this combination of stresses might influence the
   lifestyle of GTD pathogens, (2) learnings from grapevine field
   experiments and modelling aiming at studying biotic and abiotic
   stresses, and (3) what mechanistic concepts can be used to explain how
   these stresses might affect the grapevine plant status.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Background and Aims Grafted grapevines are a key component of modern
   viticulture. Grafting provides not only resistance to soil-borne pests,
   but can also improve adaptability to the environment and can improve
   fruit yield and quality. Graft incompatibility induced by grapevine
   viruses causes damage to vineyards worldwide. The aim of the present
   study was to create a rapid and reliable means of evaluating graft
   incompatibility resulting from grafting virus-infected scions onto
   healthy grape rootstocks. Methods and Results Scions of Control (healthy
   Cabernet Franc), LR131 (Cabernet Franc infected with GLRaV-1) and LR132
   (Cabernet Franc infected with GLRaV-1 and GVA) were grafted onto
   different rootstocks by micrografting, green grafting and bench grafting
   methods. All the micrografts infected with LR132 failed, while LR131 and
   Control micrografts had similar survival rates. The impact of LR132 was
   less severe on green grafted plants, followed by bench grafts. Analysis
   of variance showed an interaction of grafting method x virus variety x
   rootstock, affecting grafting survival. When grafted onto Freedom and
   101-14, LR131 inhibited the growth of both scion and rootstock, but no
   significant impact was seen when LR131 was grafted onto St. George and
   AXR1. Well-established callus was visible between the surfaces of LR131
   and the rootstocks. The virus GLRaV-1 was detected moving from the LR131
   scion source to rootstocks 7 days after micrografting. Callus formation
   was delayed by LR132 between scion and rootstock surfaces, and a
   scion-rootstock vascular connection did not establish, resulting in the
   death of all micrografts. Conclusions Micrografting is a reliable and
   sensitive method to screen for virus tolerant graft combinations
   compared with green and bench grafting. Significance of the Study The
   results of the present study validate micrografting as a means of
   producing credible information for selection of virus tolerant
   rootstocks, and ultimately vineyards with higher rates of compatible
   grafts.},

Abstract = {Grapevine is one of the most important fruit species in the world. In
   order to better understand genetic basis of traits variation and
   facilitate the breeding of new genotypes, we sequenced, assembled, and
   annotated the genome of the American native Vitis riparia, one of the
   main species used worldwide for rootstock and scion breeding. A total of
   164 Gb raw DNA reads were obtained from Vitis riparia resulting in a
   225X depth of coverage. We generated a genome assembly of the V. riparia
   grape de novo using the PacBio long-reads that was phased with the 10x
   Genomics Chromium linked-reads. At the chromosome level, a 500 Mb genome
   was generated with a scaffold N50 size of 1 Mb. More than 34\% of the
   whole genome were identified as repeat sequences, and 37,207
   protein-coding genes were predicted. This genome assembly sets the stage
   for comparative genomic analysis of the diversification and adaptation
   of grapevine and will provide a solid resource for further genetic
   analysis and breeding of this economically important species.},

Abstract = {Apple production in Southern Brazil has been increasing along the past

   Benzyladenine (BA), and Benzyladenine + Gibberellic acid(4+7) are the
   most effective on improving tree's architecture and on increasing the
   number of spurs, for all scion-rootstock combinations tested. Plant

Title = {VcFT-induced mobile florigenic signals in transgenic and transgrafted
   blueberries},
Journal = {HORTICULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) can promote early flowering in annual species,
   but such role has not been well demonstrated in woody species. We
   produced self and reciprocal grafts involving non-transgenic blueberry
   (NT) and transgenic blueberry (T) carrying a 35S-driven blueberry FT
   (VcFT-OX). We demonstrated that the transgenic VcFT-OX rootstock
   promoted flowering of non-transgenic blueberry scions in the NT
   (scion):T (rootstock) grafts. We further analyzed RNA-Seq profiles and
   six groups of phytohormones in both NT:T and NT:NT plants. We observed
   content changes of several hormone metabolites, in a descending order,
   in the transgenic NT:T, non-transgenic NT:T, and non-transgenic NT:NT
   leaves. By comparing differential expression transcripts (DETs) of these
   tissues in relative to their control, we found that the non-transgenic
   NT:T leaves had many DETs shared with the transgenic NT:T leaves, but
   very few with the transgenic NT:T roots. Interestingly, a number of
   these shared DETs belong to hormone pathway genes, concurring with the
   content changes of hormone metabolites in both transgenic and
   non-transgenic leaves of the NT:T plants. These results suggest that
   phytohormones induced by VcFT-OX in the transgenic leaves might serve as
   part of the signals that resulted in early flowering in both transgenic
   plants and the non-transgenic NT:T scions.},

Title = {Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying graft success in
   grapevine},
Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Background Grafting is an intensive commercial practice required to
   protect the European grapevine against the Phylloxera pest. Rootstocks
   resistant to this pest are hybrids of American vine species with
   different levels of compatibility with European Vitis vinifera
   varieties. Aiming to understand what drives grafting compatibility in
   grapevine, a transcriptomic approach was used to search for master
   regulators of graft success. Two scion/rootstock combinations, with
   different levels of compatibility, were compared in a nursery-grafting
   context at two stages, at 21 and 80 days after grafting. Results In the
   most compatible combination, an earlier and higher expression of genes
   signaling the metabolic and hormonal pathways as well as a reduced
   expression of genes of the phenolic metabolism and of the oxidative
   stress response was observed. At 80 days after grafting a higher
   expression of transcription factors regulating vascular maintenance,
   differentiation and proliferation was obtained in the most compatible
   combination. Moreover, lower expression levels of microRNAs potentially
   targeting important transcription factors related to plant development
   was observed in the more compatible combination when compared to the
   less compatible one. Conclusion In this context, a set of regulators was
   selected as potential expression markers for early prediction of a
   compatible grafting.},

Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {Background: Intensity of drought stress and pest attacks is forecasted
   to increase in the near future posing a serious threat to natural and
   agricultural ecosystems. Knowledge on potential effects of a combined
   abiotic-biotic stress on whole-plant physiology is lacking. We monitored
   the water status and carbon metabolism of a vine rootstock with or
   without scion subjected to water shortening and/or infestation with the
   sucking insect phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch). We measured
   non-structural carbohydrates and biomass of different plant organs to
   assess the stress-induced responses at the root, stem, and leaf level.
   Effects of watering on root infestation were also addressed.
   Results: Higher root infestation was observed in drought-stressed plants
   compared to well-watered. The drought had a significant impact on most
   of the measured functional traits. Phylloxera further influenced vines
   water and carbon metabolism and enforced the sink strength of the roots
   by stimulating photosynthates translocation. The insect induced carbon
   depletion, reprogramed vine development, while preventing biomass
   compensation. A synergic effect of biotic-abiotic stress could be
   detected in several physiological and morphological traits.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that events of water shortage favour
   insects' feeding damage and increase the abundance of root nodosities.
   Root phylloxera infestation imposes a considerable stress to the plants
   which might exacerbate the negative effects of drought.},

Abstract = {Canker and wood rot pathogens cause dieback and, in severe cases, the
   death of young apple trees. Recently, a higher occurrence of cankers was
   observed on 1-year-old apple trees in the Western Cape Province of South
   Africa. This study aimed to assess the phytosanitary status of nursery
   trees and propagation material as possible inoculum sources for canker
   pathogens. Thirteen 1-year-old apple orchards showing canker or dieback
   symptoms were sampled. Certified nursery apple trees were collected from
   four nurseries as well as scion and rootstock mother plant material.
   Isolations were made from the discoloration observed in the vascular
   tissue of the plant parts and from asymptomatic material. Possible
   canker and wood rot species were identified with PCR and sequence
   comparisons of the relevant gene regions and phylogenetic analyses.
   Similar canker and wood rot species were isolated from 1-year-old
   diseased apple trees, nursery apple trees, and the propagation material.
   Forty-five fungal species associated with canker or wood rot symptoms
   were identified. The top five most abundant fungal species found causing
   disease on commercial 1-year-old trees were also found in high numbers
   causing latent infection in certified apple nursery trees. These species
   were Didymosphaeria rubi-ulmifolii sensu lato, Diplodia seriata,
   Schizophyllum commune, Didymella pomorum, and Coniochaeta fasciculata,
   with D. rubi-ulmifolii sensu lato being the dominant species in both
   sampling materials. In all, 65\% of certified nursery apple trees, 5\%
   of scion shoots used for budding, and 21\% of rooted rootstock cuttings
   from layer blocks had latent infections of canker and wood rot
   pathogens. Pathogenicity trials were conducted with isolates of 39
   species, inoculated onto 2-year-old branches of 14-year-old Golden
   Delicious trees. All species caused lesions that were significantly
   longer than the control. This study confirmed the presence of canker and
   wood rot pathogens in apple propagation material as well as certified
   nursery apple trees, which will aid the improvement of management
   practices in nurseries.},

Title = {Expression of stilbene synthase VqSTS6 from wild Chinese Vitis
   quinquangularis in grapevine enhances resveratrol production and powdery
   mildew resistance},
Journal = {PLANTA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {250},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Main conclusion In grape (Vitis), stilbene phytoalexins can either be in
   situ synthesized or transported to the site of response during powdery
   mildew infection, enhancing disease resistance. Resveratrol is a
   phytoprotective stilbenoid compound that is synthesized by stilbene
   synthase (STS) in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and is also
   known to have health benefits in the human diet. We have previously
   shown that transgenic Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless plants
   overexpressing a stilbene synthase gene, VqSTS6, from wild Chinese Vitis
   quinquangularis had a higher stilbenoid content, leading to an enhanced
   resistance to powdery mildew (Uncinula necator (Schw.) Burr). However,
   the biosynthesis and transportation in the plant tissue under powdery
   mildew infection are still unclear. Here, inhibitor and micro-grafting
   technologies were used to study the accumulation of resveratrol
   following powdery mildew infection. We observed that the levels of STS
   expression and stilbenoids increased in response to powdery mildew
   infection. Powdery mildew and inhibitor treatment on detached grape
   branches showed that resveratrol was in situ synthesized. Experiments
   with grafted plantlets showed that the abundance of stilbenoid compounds
   increased in the shoot during VqSTS6 overexpression in the root, while
   VqSTS6-Flag fusion was not tranported to the scions and only expressed
   in the transgenic rootstocks. Compared with wild-type Thompson Seedless
   plants, the non-transgenic/VqSTS6 transgenic (scion/rootstock) grafted
   Thompson Seedless plantlets exhibited increased resistance to powdery
   mildew. In addition, overexpression of VqSTS6 in roots led to increased
   levels of stilbenoid compounds in five other European grape varieties
   (V. vinifera cvs. Chardonnay, Perlette, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling and
   Muscat Hamburg). In conclusion, stilbenoid compounds can be either in
   situ synthesized or transported to the site of powdery mildew infection,
   and overexpression of VqSTS6 in the root promotes stilbenoids
   accumulation and disease resistance in European grapevine varieties.},

Title = {Controversies in Midday Water Potential Regulation and Stomatal Behavior
   Might Result From the Environment, Genotype, and/or Rootstock: Evidence
   From Carmenere and Syrah Grapevine Varieties},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {Controversies exist regarding the iso/anisohydric continuum for
   classifying plant water-use strategies. Isohydricity has been argued to
   result from plant-environment interaction rather than it being an
   intrinsic property of the plant itself. Discrepancies remain regarding
   the degree of isohydricity (sigma) of plants and their threshold for
   physiological responses and resistance to drought. Thus, the aim of this
   study was to evaluate the isohydricity of the grapevine varieties Syrah
   and Carmenere under a non-lethal water deficit progression from veraison
   from two different locations, the Cachapoal Valley (CV) and Maipo Valley
   (MV), in central Chile and with different rootstock only in Syrah. For
   this purpose, the midday stem water potential (psi(mds)) regulation and
   stomatal responses to drought, leaf traits related to pressure-volume
   curves, stomatal sensitivity to ABA, cavitation threshold, and
   photosynthetic responses were assessed. A higher atmospheric water
   demand was observed in the CV compared to the MV, with lower psi(mds)
   values in the former for both varieties. Also, the sigma values in
   Carmenere were 1.11 +/- 0.14 MPa MPa-1 and 0.68 +/- 0.18 MPa MPa-1 in
   the CV and MV, respectively, and in Syrah they were 1.10 +/- 0.07 MPa
   MPa-1 in the CV and 0.60 +/- 0.10 MPa MPa-1 in the MV. Even though
   similar variations in sigma between locations in both varieties were
   evident, Carmenere plants showed a conserved stomatal response to
   psi(mds) in both study sites, while those of Syrah resulted in a higher
   stomatal sensitivity to psi(mds) in the site of lower sigma. Besides the
   differences in seasonal weather conditions, it is likely that the
   different rootstock and clonal variability of each season in Syrah were
   able to induce coordinated changes in sigma, psi(gs12), and osmotic
   potential at full turgor (pi(0)). On the other hand, irrespective of the
   sigma, and given the similarity between the pi(0) and psi(gs12) in
   leaves before drought, it seems that pi(0) could be a convenient tool
   for assessing the psi(mds) threshold values posing a risk to the plants
   in order to aid the irrigation decision making in grapevines under
   controlled water deficit. Finally, water deficits in vineyards might
   irreversibly compromise the photosynthetic capacity of leaves.},

Abstract = {Background and Aims Generally, grapevine roots have been less studied
   than the above-ground parts of the plant. Here we analyse
   scion-rootstock interactions in mature vines growing in a heavy clay
   soil in a climate characterised by severe summer drought to investigate
   the effect of the scion-rootstock interaction in a suboptimal soil.
   Methods and Results The rootstocks, 34 Ecole de Montpellier, 140 Ruggeri
   and 1103 Paulsen, were grafted onto Nerello Mascalese and Nero d'Avola
   scions and assessed along with self-rooted vines. Root distribution and
   root architecture were analysed using the profile wall method at 0, 60
   and 120 cm from the row midline. Root density was greatest at a depth
   between 21 and 60 cm. The cumulative root fraction for root density
   registered a beta value, a numerical quantity that summarises depth
   distribution, ranging between 0.932 and 0.962. Root number and density
   were significantly lower for the self-rooted vines compared to that of
   the grafted vines. Conclusions The scion genotypes affected most
   developmental parameters, including the diameter of the root system, the
   root density at 21-80 cm depth and the ratio of fine roots to coarse
   roots. Significance of the Study The scion plays an important role in
   grapevine root growth, development and distribution in a heavy clay
   soil, although the mechanism remains unclear.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {183},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-98},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: Rootstocks play an essential role in grapevine
   scion growth and development. They influence water and nutrient uptake
   and affect biomass allocation of the scion and the grape berry
   composition connected with wine quality. Nitrogen (N) can be taken up by
   the roots in various forms such as nitrate, ammonium or urea. These
   N-forms and their possible differential assimilation directly and
   indirectly influence grapevine vegetative and generative growth. N
   assimilation is driven by N acquiring enzymes such as nitrate reductase
   (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR) and glutamine synthetase (GS). This
   assimilation physiology can be influenced by factors such as light
   conditions or substrate availability. Methods: Hydroponically grown
   grapevine rootstocks were fertilized with various N-forms, namely
   calcium nitrate (CaN), ammonium (AM), urea (UR), and glutamine (Gln).
   The transcript expression of the enzymes NR, NiR and GS and the
   enzymatic nitrate reductase activity (eNRA) were examined at various
   time points (0 h, 3 h, and 6 h) after N application. Results and
   Conclusion: The data suggest that the grapevine rootstock SO4 has the
   ability to assimilate the amino acid Gln. Furthermore, AM, UR, and in
   some organs Gln, can regulate the co-enzymes NR and NiR, both of which
   function as activators of the NO3 - assimilation process. The eNRA is
   clearly defined by the plant organ.},

Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Background: Grafting with rootstocks is essential for the culture of
   many perennial fruit crops and is increasing being used in the
   production of annual fruits and vegetables. Our previous work based on
   microarrays showed that transcripts encoding enzymes of both primary and
   secondary metabolism were differentially expressed during graft union
   formation in both homo-grafts (a genotype grafted with itself) and
   hetero-grafts (two different genotypes grafted together). The aim of
   this study was to profile primary and secondary metabolites, and
   quantify the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and neutral
   invertase (NI) in the scion and rootstock tissues and the graft
   interface of homo and hetero-grafts of grapevine 1 month after grafting.
   Table-top grafting was done on over-wintering stems (canes) of grapevine
   and the graft interface tissues (containing some woody stem tissues and
   callus) were compared to the surrounding rootstock and scion tissues.
   The objective was to identify compounds involved in graft union
   formation and hetero-grafting responses.
   Results: A total of 54 compounds from primary and secondary metabolism
   (19 amino acids, five primary and 30 secondary compounds metabolites)
   and the activity of two enzymes were measured. The graft interface was
   associated with an increase in the accumulation of the branched-chain
   amino acids, basic amino acids, certain stilbene compounds and higher
   PAL and NI activity in comparison to the surrounding woody stem tissues.
   Some amino acids and stilbenes were identified as being accumulated
   differently between the graft interfaces of the scion/rootstock
   combinations in a manner which was unrelated to their concentrations in
   the surrounding woody stem tissues.
   Conclusions: This study revealed the modification of primary metabolism
   to support callus cell formation and the stimulation of stilbene
   synthesis at the graft interface, and how these processes are modified
   by hetero-grafting. Knowledge of the metabolites and/or enzymes required
   for successful graft union formation offer us the potential to identify
   markers that could be used by nurseries and researchers for selection
   and breeding purposes.},

Title = {Influence of the three main genetic, backgrounds of grapevine rootstocks
   on petiolar nutrient concentrations of the scion, with a focus on
   phosphorus},
Journal = {OENO ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Abstract = {Background and aims: In most viticultural areas of the world, Vitis
   vinifera grapevines require grafting onto phylloxera-tolerant rootstocks
   of American origin. The species most commonly used in rootstock creation
   are Vitis berlandieri, V. riparia and V. rupestris. Rootstocks not only
   provide tolerance to phylloxera but also ensure the supply of water and
   mineral nutrients to the scion. The aim of the study was to investigate
   the extent to which rootstocks with different genetic backgrounds modify
   the mineral composition of the petioles of the scion.
   Methods and results: Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet-Sauvignon grapevines
   were grafted onto rootstocks of 13 different genotypes and planted in a
   vineyard in three blocks. Petiolar concentrations of 13 mineral elements
   at veraison (berry softening) were determined. The genetic background of
   the rootstock had significant effects on the mineral composition of the
   petioles. Use of rootstocks with a genetic background including at least
   one Vitis riparia parent decreased the concentration of phosphorus and
   magnesium and increased the concentration of sulphur in the petioles of
   Cabernet-Sauvignon.
   Conclusion: Rootstocks with a Vitis riparia genetic background confer
   low petiolar concentrations of phosphorus and magnesium, and conversely,
   high petiolar concentration of sulphur.
   Significance of the study: The kind of rootstock onto which a grapevine
   has been grafted is known to influence the nutrient content of the
   scion. The results of the study show a significant relation between the
   genetic background of a rootstock and its ability to modify
   concentrations of phosphorus, magnesium and sulphur in the petioles of
   the scion under field conditions.},

Abstract = {The current study aimed to evaluate the productive components and
   physicochemical traits of white and red grapes from hybrids and Vitis
   labrusca grafted on different rootstocks under Brazilian subtropical
   conditions, Red grapes varieties ('Isabel', `Bord8', `IAC 138-22 Maximo'
   and `BRS Violeta') and white grapes varieties ('IAC 116-31 Rainha', `IAC
   21-14 Madalena' and `BRS Lorena') were grafted on two rootstocks ('IAC
   766' and `106-8 Mgt') and therefore assessed during cultivation. The 14
   scion-rootstock combinations were analysed during four consecutive
   harvests (from 2011 to 2014) for yield components (number of bunches,
   yield per vine, and productivity) and physicochemical traits of bunches
   and berries (fresh mass, length and width of bunchs, berries and rachis,
   soluble solids content, pH, titratable acidity and maturity index of
   grape must). Results showed that `IAC 138-22 Maximo' was the most
   productive hybrid, but also presented low soluble solids content and
   high titratable acidity. Regarding to white grapes varieties, `BRS
   Lorena' performed the highest yield associated with high sugar content
   in grapes. Rootstocks influenced some grapevine traits, but with
   variations among the grape varieties. In general, in terms of yield and
   physicochemical characteristics of the grapes, the cultivars `IAC 138-22
   Maximo', `BRS Lorena' and `Bordia' presented better results grafted on
   `IAC 766'. In contrast, `Isabel' and `IAC 116-31 Rainha' were better
   combined with the `106-8 Mgt'. The `1AG 766' and `106-8 Mgt' resulted in
   similar performances in `BRS Violeta' and `IAC 21-14 Madalena', for that
   reason, both rootstocks may be recommended for these varieties.},

Abstract = {Viticulture is facing water deficit problems related to climate change,
   new extremes in heat and precipitation regimes and drought events.
   Rootstocks use was assessed as strategy for enhancing performance of
   Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) and Syrah (Sy) under water deficit. Vines were
   grafted onto naturalized grapevines selected from hyper-arid Chile, and
   compared to own-grafted and commercial Ruggeri 140. Plants were
   submitted to optimal (100 \% ETc) and deficit (30 \% ETc) irrigation
   throughout two seasons at field conditions. Functional traits along both
   seasons were determined. Water deficit reduced all growth and
   physiological traits especially in CS. R32 rootstock induced
   significantly higher values for most traits irrespective of cv and
   seasons associated to higher root growth. Transcriptomic analysis was
   further performed in both cultivars grafted over R32 rootstock by
   RNA-Seq, determining that gene up-regulation extent was higher in Sy.
   More stable transcriptional landscape was determined in CS than Sy,
   which might be linked to its hydric strategy. Unexpectedly, major
   differences in transcriptional behaviour were detected in R32 rootstock,
   revealing major transcriptional changes occurring at root level,
   suggesting scion-driven transcriptional regulation in response to
   stress. Finally, R32 rootstock can be considered for both near iso and
   anisohydric grapevines as adaptive strategy for climate constrains.},

Abstract = {Environmental stress factors caused by climate change affect plant
   growth and crop production, and pose a growing threat to sustainable
   agriculture, especially for tree crops. In this context, we sought to
   investigate the responses to climate change of two Prunus rootstocks
   (GF677 and Adesoto) budded with Catherina peach cultivar. Plants were
   grown in 15 L pots in temperature gradient greenhouses for an 18 days
   acclimation period after which six treatments were applied: {[}CO2
   levels (400 versus 700 mu mol mol(-1)), temperature (ambient versus
   ambient + 4 degrees C), and water availability (well irrigated versus
   drought)]. After 23 days, the effects of stress were evaluated as
   changes in physiological and biochemical traits, including expression of
   relevant genes. Stem water potential decreased under drought stress in
   plants grafted on GF677 and Adesoto rootstocks; however, elevated CO2
   and temperature affected plant water content differently in both
   combinations. The photosynthetic rate of plants grafted on GF677
   increased under high CO2, but decreased under high temperature and
   drought conditions. The photosynthetic rates of plants grafted onto
   Adesoto were only affected by drought treatment. Furthermore, in
   GF677-Catherina plants, elevated CO2 alleviated the effect of drought,
   whereas in those grafted onto Adesoto, the same condition produced
   acclimation in the rate. Stomatal conductance decreased under high CO2
   and drought stress in both grafted rootstocks, and the combination of
   these conditions improved water-use efficiency. Changes in the sugar
   content in scion leaves and roots were significantly different under the
   stress conditions in both combinations. Meanwhile, the expression of
   most of the assessed genes was significantly affected by treatment.
   Regarding genotypes, GF677 rootstock showed more changes at the
   molecular and transcriptomic level than did Adesoto rootstock. A
   coordinated shift was found between the physiological status and the
   transcriptomic responses. This study revealed adaptive responses to
   climate change at the physiological, metabolic, and transcriptomic
   levels in two Prunus rootstocks budded with `Catherina'. Overall, these
   results demonstrate the resilient capacity and plasticity of these
   contrasting genotypes, which can be further used to combat ongoing
   climate changes and support sustainable peach production.},

Abstract = {The development and evaluation of new cultivars of seedless grapes
   (Vitis spp.) with good yield and adapted to different edaphoclimatic
   conditions are essential to increase the competitiveness of the
   productive system. The present work had the objective to characterize
   the phenology and the yield of the new hybrid seedless grape `BRS
   Melodia', grown in an annual double cropping system in a subtropical
   region. The evaluations were carried out during the 2013 summer cropping
   period and the 2014 off-season cropping period in a commercial area
   located in Marialva, PR, Brazil. The `BRS Melodia' scions were grafted
   onto `IAC 766 Campinas' rootstocks, trained in an overhead trellis
   system spaced at 2.5 x 2.5 m. In both seasons, the duration in days of
   the main phenological phases of the vines, as well as their thermal
   demand and their physicochemical and productive characteristics were
   evaluated. The `BRS Melodia' seedless grapevines presented a cycle of
   138 days and yield of 23.85 tons.ha(-1) in the summer season, and 121
   days and yield of 19.4 tons.ha(-1) in the off-season crop. The soluble
   solids, titratable acidity, and maturation index were 15.1 degrees Brix,
   0.5\% tartaric acid and 28.5, respectively, in the summer season and
   15.4 degrees Brix, 0.6\% tartaric acid and 25.6 in the off-season crop,
   indicating a possibility of cultivate this new hybrid seedless grape
   under an annual double cropping system in subtropical conditions.},

Journal = {PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {293},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pear is one of the most commercially important fruit trees worldwide and
   is widely cultivated in temperate zones. Drought stress can greatly
   limit pear fruit yield and quality. Pyrus betulaefolia Bunge, a
   drought-resistant pear rootstock that is commonly used in northern
   China, confers favourable characteristics to pear scions, allowing them
   to respond rapidly to drought stress via the transport of macromolecules
   such as phloem-mobile mRNAs. How drought-responsive mRNAs function as
   phloem-mobile signals remains unknown, however. Here, we used RNA
   sequencing (RNA-seq) combined with SNP analysis to identify mobile mRNAs
   in P. betulaefolia. We focused on mobile mRNAs that respond to drought
   stress and found that the abundance of a novel mRNA named PbDRM (P.
   betulaefoliaDROUGHT-RESPONSIVE MOBILE GENE) significantly increased in
   several different scion cultivars when they were grafted onto P.
   betulaefolia rootstock under drought conditions. In addition,
   down-regulating PbDRM by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) increased
   the drought sensitivity of P. betulaefolia. CAPS RT-PCR analysis
   confirmed that PbDRM mRNA moves from rootstock to scion in micrografting
   systems. Therefore, PbDRM mRNA acts as a phloem-mobile signal in pear
   under drought stress.},

Title = {Effects of exogenous growth regulators and bud picking on grafting of
   grapevine hard branches},
Journal = {SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {264},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {The mechanized hard-branched grafted grape propagules always had the
   problem of early sprouting, late formation of graft union point callus
   and low rooting rate, which result in low survival rate. In this study,
   the annual hard-branch 5BB as rootstock and Cabernet Sauvignon as scion
   of grafted grape propagules were treated with water (as control), bud
   picking and different gradients of growth regulators, including rooting
   powder (ABT No. 2) and chlorpropham (CIPC) to adjust the growth
   competition between the germination of the scion and the callus
   formation of the graft union and to improve the survival rate of grafted
   grape propagules. This study lasted for two years (2017-2018). Results
   showed that 250 mg/L of ABT inhibited scion sprouting, promoted callus
   formation, rootstock rooting and had the highest survival rate with
   significant effect. However, CIPC inhibited the growth indexes of
   grafted grape propagules and reduced the survival rate. Bud picking
   delayed the germination time and increased the callus formation rate.
   Furthermore, ABT and CIPC could regulate sugar accumulation and the
   metabolic activities of related enzymes such as sucrose synthase (SS),
   sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and alpha-amylase (alpha-AMS) in the
   scion bud and the phloem near the graft union. Meanwhile, ABT and CIPC
   had a distribution regulating effect on auxin (IAA), gibberellic acid
   (GA3), zeatin riboside (ZR) and abscisic acid (ABA), whereas bud picking
   had no significant effect on the accumulation of sugar and endogenous
   hormones. Correlation analysis showed that sucrose, glucose, IAA and ZR
   near the graft union had a significant positive correlation with callus
   formation, starch and sucrose accumulation in the scion buds, whereas
   the accumulation of ABA in the phloem near the graft union negatively
   regulated the callus formation. This study demonstrated that ABT and
   CIPC affected the survival rate of grafted grape propagules by
   regulating the metabolism and distribution of sugar and endogenous
   hormones.},

Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Grafting is the most used propagation method in viticulture and is the
   unique control strategy against Phylloxera. Nevertheless, its practice
   remains limited mainly due to inconsistent graft success and
   difficulties in predicting graft compatibility responses of proposed
   scion-rootstock combinations, slowing down the selection of elite
   rootstocks. Aiming to identify optimal phenotypic parameters related to
   graft (in)compatibility, we used four clones of two grapevine cultivars
   that show different compatibility behavior when grafted onto the same
   rootstock. Several physiological parameters, internal anatomy of the
   graft union, chlorophyll fluorescence, and pigment contents of homo- and
   heterografts were monitored in a nursery-grafting context. The
   measurements highlighted enhanced performance of the heterografts due to
   rooting difficulties of Vitis vinifera homografts. This suggests that in
   viticulture, homografts should only be used as compatibility controls
   regarding qualitative attributes. By observing the internal anatomy of
   the union, we found that grapevines might require longer times for graft
   healing than anticipated. While Affinity Coefficients were not
   informative to assess incompatibility, leaf chlorophyll concentration
   analysis proved to be a more sensitive indicator of stress than the
   analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence. Overall, we conclude that graft
   take correlated best with callus formation at the graft junction three
   weeks after grafting.},

Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Despite phenotypic plasticity that allows the adaptation to harsh
   environments, when vines experience severe abiotic stresses, they can
   suffer from metabolic damages affecting grape production and quality.
   Grafting is an affordable strategy to mitigate these negative
   consequences since the rootstock can increase the drought tolerance in
   the scion. This work explored the effects of pre-veraison water deficit
   on vines grafted on different rootstocks (Mgt 101-14 and 1103 Paulsen)
   to obtain physiological, biochemical, and molecular information about
   the influence on grape quality. Repeated measurements were carried out
   to assess vine physiology, production, technological maturity, and berry
   phenolic composition. qRT-PCRs were executed on berry skins at maturity
   to assess the expression levels of ten genes and five miRNAs involved in
   the phenylpropanoid pathway. Water stress caused significant alterations
   in grape technological maturity. The rootstock effect was not detected
   in primary metabolism while it was well defined in the accumulation of
   phenolic compounds in berries (such as anthocyanins). Finally,
   significant differences were identified in gene and miRNA expression
   between water-stressed and well-watered vines. In conclusion, the
   response to water stress can be modulated by rootstocks, which mainly
   act by regulating secondary metabolism, especially in grapes.},

Abstract = {Vitis riparia, a critically important Native American grapevine species,
   is used globally in rootstock and scion breeding and contributed to the
   recovery of the French wine industry during the mid-19th century
   phylloxera epidemic. This species has abiotic and biotic stress
   tolerance and the largest natural geographic distribution of the North
   American grapevine species. Here we report an Illumina short-read 369X
   coverage, draft de novo heterozygous genome sequence of V. riparia
   Michx. `Manitoba 37' with the size of similar to 495Mb for 69,616
   scaffolds and a N50 length of 518,740bp. Using RNAseq data, 40,019
   coding sequences were predicted and annotated. Benchmarking with
   Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis of predicted gene
   models found 96\% of the complete BUSCOs in this assembly. The assembly
   continuity and completeness were further validated using V. riparia
   ESTs, BACs, and three de novo transcriptome assemblies of three
   different V. riparia genotypes resulting in >98\% of respective
   sequences/transcripts mapping with this assembly. Alignment of the V.
   riparia assembly and predicted CDS with the latest V. vinifera `PN40024'
   CDS and genome assembly showed 99\% CDS alignment and a high degree of
   synteny. An analysis of plant transcription factors indicates a high
   degree of homology with the V. vinifera transcription factors. QTL
   mapping to V. riparia `Manitoba 37' and V. vinifera PN40024 has
   identified genetic relationships to phenotypic variation between
   species. This assembly provides reference sequences, gene models for
   marker development and understanding V. riparia's genetic contributions

Abstract = {Background Scion physiology and grape quality are impacted by rootstock
   choice. There is little available information about the effects of
   rootstock on wine volatile composition, particularly when comparing
   grafted with own-rooted grapevines. This field trial was aimed at
   studying the influence of rootstock choice on volatile composition of
   Merlot wines.
   Results Wines made from grapes harvested from own-rooted grapevines had
   the lowest content of (E)-3-hexenol, diethyl succinate and total ethyl
   esters and the highest content of 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexenol,
   diethyl malate and acetovanillone. Rootstocks such as 99R and 140Ru led
   to a higher content of total ethyl esters in wines followed by 110R,
   1103P and Gravesac. According to odor activity values, Merlot wines were
   characterized by roses, sweat, cheese and banana aromas.
   Conclusions This work provides valuable information about the potential
   impact of rootstocks on wine volatile composition for Merlot wines. (c)

   Different Rootstock Effect},

Abstract = {Pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries have shown great interest
   in grape seed extract due to its premium antioxidant activity with
   protective effects on human health. However, global climate change has
   already negatively affected the biochemistry and functionality of such
   nutraceutical crops. The present study was conducted to reveal the
   effects of sustained deficit irrigation on certain features of seed
   extracts obtained from the grape cultivar `Prima' grafted on six
   genetically different rootstocks during two consecutive years. In both
   years, seed weight of `Prima' grapes grafted on 5 BB significantly
   decreased in response to water treatments, although the other rootstocks
   did not impair the seed weight, except for 44-53 \& x202f;M in 217.
   Significant decreases in antioxidant activity of the scion cultivar
   occurred in response to DI when grafted on 5 BB in both years and in
   44-53 \& x202f;M in 2017. However, the use of 99 \& x202f;R, 110 \&
   x202f;R and 140 Ru did not markedly impair the seed antioxidant activity
   in response to DI condition in both years. In both years, seed
   anthocyanins of FI vines were always higher than those of DI vines. In
   2017, there were significant decreases in anthocyanins due to DI in
   vines grafted on 5 BB, 44-53 \& x202f;M, 99 \& x202f;R and 110 \&
   x202f;R. These rootstocks also led significant decreases in anthocyanins
   of the second year, while the use of 140 Ru and 1613 \& x202f;C
   rootstocks did not lead significant changes in anthocyanins in both two
   years. In 2017, total phenolics increased in response to DI, except for
   the vines grafted on 44-53 \& x202f;M. Rootstock-dependent changes in
   total phenolics in response to irrigation treatments were insignificant
   for the vines grafted on 5 BB and 44-53 \& x202f;M in both two
   experimental years. Averaged data showed that antioxidant activity
   showed significantly positive correlation with anthocyanins and total
   phenols. The findings are anticipated to guide future projects on
   enhancement of the quality and quantity of precious seconder metabolites
   with sustainable precision viticulture techniques to match the globally
   increasing demands on bioactive compounds.},

Abstract = {The use of resistant rootstocks is an inevitable trend in the
   development and production of grapes (Vitis sp.). The present study
   analyzed differences in the metabolites in grape seeds of different
   rootstock combinations (1103P, 5C, SO4, 3309C, 140R, and control)
   grafted onto `Cabernet Sauvignon' (CS) wine grape (Vitis vinifera)
   scions (control, CS/CS, self-rooted grafting vines) using liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nontargeted metabolomic
   techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares
   discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal-partial least squares
   discriminant analysis identified 30 significant metabolites and 22
   metabolic pathways in the seeds of CS that differed significantly from
   the control seeds. This study revealed that rootstocks influence
   metabolite concentrations and metabolic pathways
   (alanine-aspartate-glutamate pathway, arginine-proline pathway, and the
   tricarboxylic acid cycle) in the scion onto which they are grafted. The
   rootstocks increased the concentration of
   delphinidin-3-(6-acetylglucoside), peonidin 3-(6-p-coumarylglucoside),
   L-threonine, and D-tartaric in CS seeds. Appropriate rootstock
   combinations can be used to improve the quality of grape seeds by
   changing the concentrations of amino acids, organic acids, polyphenols,
   and vitamin B. This study provides a theoretical basis for selecting
   grape rootstocks and provides important insights for improving the
   quality of commercial products derived from grape seeds.},

Abstract = {Use of proper rootstocks has the potential to improve copper (Cu)
   tolerance of grape. To evaluate the rootstock ability to reduce Cu
   transfer in the aerial portion of a grapevine, a glasshouse experiment
   was conducted to determine the physiological impact of Cu soil
   application in `Asgari' seedless grape, either non-grafted or grafted
   onto different rootstocks. Vines were supplied with a nutrient solution
   at four levels of CuSO4 concentrations (0, 10, 25 and 50 mu M). Cu
   toxicity symptoms in leaves and reduced plant growth rate were evident
   in the non-grafted `Asgari' and less pronounced in grapevines grafted
   onto `Shahani' rootstock. Moreover, `Asgari' grafted onto `Shahani'
   rootstock had lower rate of Cu accumulation in the leaves when compared
   to the roots than those of non-grafted and `Asgari' with `Keshmeshi'
   rootstock. Although significant reduction of P in non-grafted `Asgari'
   leaf tissue was found under Cu toxicity, `Shahani' rootstock reported
   the highest amount of P (5.94 mg g(-1)) in the leaves of `Asgari' scion.
   However, significant fluctuations in terms of Ca and Fe were reported in
   leaves of both grafted and non-grafted `Asgari'. When exposed to Cu
   toxicity, `Shahani' rootstock induced significant increase in
   chlorophyll content, Fv/Fm ratio and a noticeable reduction in
   electrolyte leakage, H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) compared to those
   having `Keshmeshi' rootstock and non-grafted `Asgari'. `Shahani'
   rootstock improved `Asgari' performance under Cu toxicity by slowly
   reducing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, preventing Cu accumulation
   in the aerial parts and maintaining a balanced scion nutritional status.},

Abstract = {Background In viticulture, rootstock genotype plays a critical role to
   improve scion physiology, berry quality and to adapt grapevine (Vitis
   viniferaL.) to different environmental conditions. This study aimed at
   investigating the effect of two different rootstocks (1103 Paulsen - P -
   and Mgt 101-14 - M) in comparison with not grafted plants - NGC - on
   transcriptome (RNA-seq and small RNA-seq) and chemical composition of
   berry skin inPinot noir, and exploring the influence of rootstock-scion
   interaction on grape quality. Berry samples, collected at veraison and
   maturity, were investigated at transcriptional and biochemical levels to
   depict the impact of rootstock on berry maturation. Results RNA- and
   miRNA-seq analyses highlighted that, at veraison, the transcriptomes of
   the berry skin are extremely similar, while variations associated with
   the different rootstocks become evident at maturity, suggesting a
   greater diversification at transcriptional level towards the end of the
   ripening process. In the experimental design, resembling standard
   agronomic growth conditions, the vines grafted on the two different
   rootstocks do not show a high degree of diversity. In general, the few
   genes differentially expressed at veraison were linked to
   photosynthesis, putatively because of a ripening delay in not grafted
   vines, while at maturity the differentially expressed genes were mainly
   involved in the synthesis and transport of phenylpropanoids (e.g.
   flavonoids), cell wall loosening, and stress response. These results
   were supported by some differences in berry phenolic composition
   detected between grafted and not grafted plants, in particular in
   resveratrol derivatives accumulation. Conclusions Transcriptomic and
   biochemical data demonstrate a stronger impact of 1103 Paulsen rootstock
   than Mgt 101-14 or not grafted plants on ripening processes related to
   the secondary metabolite accumulations in berry skin tissue.
   Interestingly, theMYB14gene, involved in the feedback regulation of
   resveratrol biosynthesis was up-regulated in 1103 Paulsen thus
   supporting a putative greater accumulation of stilbenes in mature
   berries.},

Title = {Transfer of endogenous small RNAs between branches of scions and
   rootstocks in grafted sweet cherry trees},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Grafting is a well-established agricultural practice in cherry
   production for clonal propagation, altered plant vigor and architecture,
   increased tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, precocity, and
   higher yield. Mobile molecules, such as water, hormones, nutrients,
   DNAs, RNAs, and proteins play essential roles in rootstock-scion
   interactions. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are 19 to 30-nucleotides (nt) RNA
   molecules that are a group of mobile signals in plants.
   Rootstock-to-scion transfer of transgene-derived small interfering RNAs
   enabled virus resistance in nontransgenic sweet cherry scion. To
   determine whether there was long-distance scion-to-rootstock transfer of
   endogenous sRNAs, we compared sRNAs profiles in bud tissues of an
   ungrafted `Gisela 6' rootstock, two sweet cherry `Emperor Francis'
   scions as well as their `Gisela 6' rootstocks. Over two million sRNAs
   were detected in each sweet cherry scion, where 21-nt sRNA (56.1\% and
   55.8\%) being the most abundant, followed by 24-nt sRNAs (13.1\% and
   12.5\%). Furthermore, we identified over three thousand sRNAs that were
   potentially transferred from the sweet cherry scions to their
   corresponding rootstocks. In contrast to the sRNAs in scions, among the
   transferred sRNAs in rootstocks, the most abundant were 24-nt sRNAs
   (46.3\% and 34.8\%) followed by 21-nt sRNAs (14.6\% and 19.3\%). In
   other words, 21-nt sRNAs had the least transferred proportion out of the
   total sRNAs in sources (scions) while 24-nt had the largest proportion.
   The transferred sRNAs were from 574 cherry transcripts, of which 350 had
   a match from theArabidopsis thalianastandard protein set. The finding
   that ``DNA or RNA binding activity{''} was enriched in the transcripts
   producing transferred sRNAs indicated that they may affect the
   biological processes of the rootstocks at different regulatory levels.
   Overall, the profiles of the transported sRNAs and their annotations
   revealed in this study facilitate a better understanding of the role of
   the long-distance transported sRNAs in sweet cherry rootstock-scion
   interactions as well as in branch-to-branch interactions in a tree.},

Journal = {BMC RESEARCH NOTES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe root knot nematodes (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita can
   severely reduce grapevine yields over time. Grapevine rootstocks have
   been developed from wild Vitis species that provide resistance to
   nematode infections. However, the potential biochemical or mechanical
   mechanisms of resistance have not been thoroughly explored. Therefore,
   this study measured levels of stilbenoids in roots of non-infected and
   RKN-infected grapevines with Cabernet Sauvignon scion grafted to
   susceptible (O39-16) or resistant (Freedom) rootstocks. This was part of
   a larger effort to assess phenolic compound levels within grapevine
   rootstocks to determine roles of stilbenoid compounds in improving
   nematode resistance and overall plant health.ResultsNone of the assessed
   compounds were consistently greater in RKN infected plants versus
   healthy controls. Stilbenoids putatively identified as pallidol,
   ?-viniferin, miyabenol C, and hopeaphenol were overall much greater in
   Freedom than O39-16 rootstocks. By contrast, the stilbenoids ampelopsin
   A, omega -viniferin, and vitisin B were greater in O39-16 than Freedom.
   O39-16 and Freedom had similar levels of other stilbenoids especially
   monomers and dimers. Potentially the greater levels of specific
   stilbenoids present in Freedom than O39-16 provided RKN resistance. If
   validated, breeding programs could utilize the increased presence of
   these compounds as a marker for increased resistance to nematodes.},

Abstract = {Grapevines (Vitis spp.) host viruses belonging to 17 families.
   Virus-associated diseases are a constant challenge to grape production.
   Genetic resources for breeding virus-resistant grape cultivars are

   and is resistant to powdery mildew and downy mildew. In this study, we
   assessed resistance of `Norton' to grapevine vein clearing virus (GVCV),
   which is prevalent in native, wild Vitaceae and in vineyards in the
   Midwest region of the U.S. We did not detect GVCV in `Norton' as either
   the scion or the rootstock up to 3 years after it was grafted with a
   GVCV-infected `Chardonel' grapevine. Upon sequencing of small RNAs, we
   were able to assemble the GVCV genome from virus small RNAs in
   GVCV-infected `Chardonel' scion or rootstock, but not from grafted
   `Norton' scion and rootstock. This study unveils a new trait of `Norton'
   that can be used in breeding GVCV-resistant grape cultivars, and to
   investigate genetic mechanisms of `Norton' resistance to GVCV.},

Abstract = {BackgroundGrafting is widely used in horticulture and rootstocks are
   known to modify scion growth and adaptation to soil conditions. However,
   the role of scion genotype in regulating rootstock development and
   functioning has remained largely unexplored. In this study, reciprocal
   grafts of two grapevine genotypes were produced as well as the
   corresponding homo-graft controls. These plants were subjected to a low
   phosphate (LP) treatment and transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing
   was done on root samples collected 27h after the onset of the LP
   treatment.ResultsA set of transcripts responsive to the LP treatment in
   all scion/rootstock combinations was identified. Gene expression
   patterns associated with genetic variation in response to LP were
   identified by comparing the response of the two homo-grafts. In
   addition, the scion was shown to modify root transcriptome responses to
   LP in a rootstock dependent manner. A weighted gene co-expression
   network analysis identified modules of correlated genes; the analysis of
   the association of these modules with the phosphate treatment, and the
   scion and rootstock genotype identified potential hub

Journal = {PLANT SCIENCE},

Volume = {299},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The rootstock M4 (V. vinifera x V. berlandieri) x V. berlandieri cv.
   Resseguier n.1) is a recent selection reported to confer improved
   drought tolerance to grafted V. vinifera scions, a very desired feature
   in the era of global warming. Therefore, a short-term study was
   performed on a batch of 12 potted cv. Sangiovese vines grafted either on
   M4 or on the drought susceptible SO4 rootstock. Ecophysiological
   assessments as whole canopy net CO2 exchange rate (NCER), transpiration
   (T-c), and pre-dawn leaf water potential (Psi(pd)) and UHPLC-ESI/QTOF-MS
   metabolomics were then used to investigate the different vine responses
   during water limiting conditions. Water stress was induced by applying
   50 \% of estimated daily water use from days of year 184-208.
   M4 was able to deliver similar CO2, at a significantly reduced water
   use, compared to SO4 grafting. In turn, this resulted in enhanced canopy
   water use efficiency (NCER/T-c ratio) quantified as +15.1 \% during
   water stress and +21.7 \% at re-watering. Untargeted metabolomics showed
   a similar modulation of brassinosteroids and ABA between the two
   rootstocks, whereas the up accumulation of cytokinins and gibberellins
   under drought was peculiar of M4 grafted vines. The increase in
   gibberellins, together with a concurrent down accumulation of
   chlorophyll precursors and catabolites and an up accumulation of folates
   in M4 rootstock suggests that the capacity of limiting
   reactive-oxygen-species and redox imbalance under drought stress was
   improved. Finally, distinctive osmolyte accumulation patterns could be
   observed, with SO4 investing more on proline and glycinebetaine content
   and M4 primarily showing polyols accumulation.},

Abstract = {In modern horticulture, grafting is widely used to confer biotic and
   abiotic stress tolerance, which can also affect many scion phenotypes,
   such as the physiochemical, phenolic and aroma compositions of grape
   berries. In this study, the effects of five rootstocks (101-14, 1103P,
   Beta, 5BB and SO4) on the berry ripening and aromatic profiles of
   Chardonnay (CH) grape berries over two years (2016 and 2017) were
   evaluated and some differences were observed. Compared to the own-rooted
   vines, berry weight was increased by the rootstocks to varying extents
   and the berries from all the five grafted vines accumulated
   significantly lower total soluble solids (TSS). CH/101-14 increased the
   berries' titratable acid (TA) to varying degree, showing decreased
   TSS/TA ratio in CH/101-14 and suggesting tendency for retarding
   maturation. All the rootstocks except SO4 could enhance both the total
   amounts of free- and bound-form volatile compounds, especially CH/1103P.
   Five volatile compounds, free-benzeneacetaldehyde, bound-1-octen-3-ol,
   bound-(E)-2-nonenal, bound-1,2,4-trimethyl-benzene and
   bound-1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-benzene were identified to have significant

   for each rootstock were also screened out. Combined with the

   1103P could significantly improve the free and bound volatile compounds

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the susceptibility to flavescence
   doree (FD) of 12 Vitis vinifera cultivars grown in Piedmont, and
   representative of the wine-making tradition of this area. The
   experiments were conducted under controlled conditions to ensure
   constant infection pressure. Test plants were ex vitro potted vines,
   singly inoculated with four Scaphoideus titanus infected by FD-C
   phytoplasma (FDp), under greenhouse conditions. Vines were tested for
   FDp at 5 and 8 weeks postinoculation (wpi) and the phytoplasma load was
   measured in leaves and roots at 8 wpi. Within the 14 V. vinifera
   accessions (belonging to 12 cultivars), three susceptibility clusters
   were identified. Cultivars within the low susceptibility group showed
   low phytoplasma loads and low percentages of infected plants, suggesting
   a tolerant behaviour. To confirm these results, four Vitis cultivars,
   representing extremes of FD susceptibility from low to high, were
   grafted onto Kober 5BB rootstocks and inoculated with
   laboratory-infected S. titanus, under semi-field conditions. The
   transmission experiments onto grafted cuttings confirmed that
   susceptibility to the disease depends on the scion genotype. The data
   indicated that none of the tested V. vinifera genotypes are resistant to
   FD, although some cultivars with low susceptibility are available, and
   can be explored for identifying genetic traits involved in disease
   tolerance/resistance. Moreover, ranking Vitis genotypes for their
   susceptibility to FD is in itself a valuable tool to support vine
   growers in their decision management, by helping them to choose the most
   appropriate varieties according to their specific FD epidemiological
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Excess water in vineyard soils during grapevine growing season is
   expected to become a critical issue in Japan. The objective of this
   study was to investigate the effects of constantly high soil water
   content which was controlled at constantly more than 20\% water content
   in soil on vegetative growth and berry quality of Cabernet Sauvignon
   over a 3-year growing season. A wireless sensor networking system for
   real-time monitoring of soil moisture was used to check that the
   experimental plot had constantly more than 20\% water content in soil.
   Veraison in the experimental plot controlled at constantly high soil
   water content started 10 days, 4 days and 1 day later than that in the
   non-irrigated experimental plot in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 growing
   seasons, respectively. The constantly high soil water content had no
   notable effects on berry quality, such as berry characteristics and
   berry composition, at harvest compared with the non-irrigated
   experimental plot, although there was a certain tendency that constantly
   high soil water content decreased anthocyanin contents in berry skins
   compared with those of non-irrigated grapevines during the three growing
   seasons. We postulated that waterlogging damage due to the increase in
   soil water content by frequent rainfall would be minimised by the
   selection of rootstock that confers tolerance to waterlogging stress for
   scion cultivars and/or viticultural practices to prevent decrease in
   soil temperature. Also, the introduction of Internet of Things
   technology for monitoring water status in vineyard soil is expected to
   contribute to improving practical approaches to vineyard soil water
   management.},

Abstract = {Mechanistic modeling constitutes a powerful tool to unravel complex
   biological phenomena. This study describes the construction of a
   mechanistic, dynamic model for grapevine plant growth and canopy biomass
   (vigor). To parametrize and validate the model, the progeny from a cross
   of Ramsey (Vitis champinii) x Riparia Gloire (V. riparia) was evaluated.
   Plants with different vigor were grown in a greenhouse during the summer
   of 2014 and 2015. One set of plants was grafted with Cabernet Sauvignon.
   Shoot growth rate (b), leaf area (LA), dry biomass, whole plant and root
   specific hydraulic conductance (k(H) and L-pr), stomatal conductance
   (g(s)), and water potential (Psi) were measured. Partitioning indices
   and specific leaf area (SLA) were calculated. The model includes an
   empirical fit of a purported seasonal pattern of bioactive GAs based on
   published seasonal evolutionary levels and reference values. The model
   provided a good fit of the experimental data, with R 1/4 0.85.
   Simulation of single trait variations defined the individual effect of
   each variable on vigor determination. The model predicts, with
   acceptable accuracy, the vigor of a young plant through the measurement
   of L-pr and SLA. The model also permits further understanding of the
   functional traits that govern vigor, and, ultimately, could be
   considered useful for growers, breeders and those studying climate

Abstract = {Viticulture is facing emerging challenges not only because of the effect
   of climate change on yield and composition of grapes, but also of a
   social demand for environmental-friendly agricultural management.
   Adaptation to these challenges is essential to guarantee the
   sustainability of viticulture. The aim of this review is to present
   adaptation possibilities from the soil-hidden, and often disregarded,
   part of the grapevine, the roots. The complexity of soil-root
   interactions makes necessary a comprehensive approach taking into
   account physiology, pathology and genetics, in order to outline
   strategies to improve viticulture adaptation to current and future
   threats. Rootstocks are the link between soil and scion in grafted
   crops, and they have played an essential role in viticulture since the
   introduction of phylloxera into Europe at the end of the 19th century.
   This review outlines current and future challenges that are threatening
   the sustainability of the wine sector and the relevant role that
   rootstocks can play to face these threats. We describe how rootstocks
   along with soil management can be exploited as an essential tool to deal
   with the effects of climate change and of emerging soil-borne pests and
   pathogens. Moreover, we discuss the possibilities and limitations of
   diverse genetic strategies for rootstock breeding.},

Abstract = {Crop components, such as trellis systems, might affect solar radiation
   uptake by grapevines while others, such as rootstocks, influence the
   vigor of the scion. Proper management provides a suitable reproductive
   and vegetative balance that could influence the chemical composition of
   grapes. This study aimed to characterize the global phenolic composition
   and antioxidant activity of `Isabel Precoce' grapes raised for juice,
   growing under different trellis systems and rootstocks, in rainy
   seasons, in semi-Arid conditions in Brazil. With a randomized block
   experimental design and split-split plots over time, the overhead
   trellis, lyre, and vertical shoot positioning systems and two rootstocks
   ('IAC 572' and `IAC 766') in the harvest seasons of January-May, 2017
   and January-May, 2018 were studied. Trellis systems, rootstocks, harvest
   seasons and their interactions affected the characteristics of the
   grapes. The treatments with equivalent responses in the seasons defined
   the specific characteristics of the grapes. The rootstock `IAC 766'
   provided greater bunch weight and lower acidity to the `Isabel Precoce'
   grapes, while `IAC 572' induced higher soluble solids contents. In both
   seasons, there was lower variation in berry resistance to compression
   and polyphenol and anthocyanin contents in grapes from grapevines grown
   on an overhead trellis. In turn, the use of lyre provided high
   antioxidant activity by the ABTS(center dot+) method in 2018. The
   highest antioxidant activity by the DPPH. method was due to the
   association of overhead trellis and `IAC 766'. With the use of the
   overhead trellis, equivalent phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity
   during the seasons resulted in a uniform quality.},

Abstract = {Recently, so-called `generative' rootstocks have been introduced by seed
   companies. This type of rootstock is supposed to limit excessive
   vegetative growth and promote steady fruit production throughout the
   season in grafted tomato production. In contrast, `vegetative'
   rootstocks have a tendency to cause excessive vegetative growth in
   grafted plants, leading to possible delay in onset of flowering and
   fruit set. Little research-based information is currently available to
   characterize such effects of generative and vegetative rootstocks on
   growth and development of grafted tomatoes. In this greenhouse study,
   eight tomato hybrid rootstocks with different descriptions of their
   attributes including generative, vegetative, vigorous, and mid vigor,
   were grafted with two grape tomato scions and two beefsteak tomato
   scions. Interactions significantly affected plant height, node number,
   stem diameter, and SPAD at early vegetative stage but did not affect
   stem diameter and SPAD at a late vegetative stage. Rootstocks had no
   effect on flowering date of the scion. The interactions of rootstock x
   scion type and rootstock x scion cultivar significantly affected leaf
   number, leaf area, and biomass accumulation in reproductive parts, leaf,
   stem and roots at the vegetative growth stage but not at the transition
   stage or at the beginning of harvest. For both tomato types, root dry
   weight and root surface area helped in discriminating different groups,
   but did not consistently drive the separation between different
   treatments. A consistent grouping pattern was not found among different
   scion types.},

Abstract = {Lemon (Citrus limon), an interspecific hybrid between sour orange and
   citron, has been widely used as a rootstock along with trifoliate
   orange. Though lemons are superior to trifoliate orange in terms of
   their high seed germination rate throughout the year, one of the
   obstacles to using lemons as rootstocks is the lack of reliable,
   lemon-specific molecular markers to discriminate buds of the
   micro-grafted scion from those of the lemon rootstock. In order to
   obtain lemon-specific molecular markers, we compared the whole-plastid
   genomes available from four citrus species (lemon, pummelo, sweet
   orange, and mandarin) and developed seven plastid insertion/deletion
   (InDel) markers. The plastid InDel markers were applied to 46 citrus
   accessions that included lemons (17 accessions), grapefruit, mandarin,
   pummelo, sour orange, orange, papeda, tangor, and tangelo groups. The
   resulting dendrogram revealed that the citrus accessions used in this
   analysis could be distinctly classified into seven clusters. Lemons
   formed a separate cluster and had identical allele sizes for each InDel
   locus among all accessions investigated. This set of InDel markers could
   be a useful molecular tool for the rapid and clear discrimination of
   micro-grafted scions and lemon rootstocks during the production of
   virus-free citrus trees. The plastid InDel markers with maternal
   inheritance features can also be used to analyze the phylogenetic origin
   of various citrus cultivars including lemons.},

Abstract = {The selection of rootstocks presenting traits of interest, such as
   resistance to pests and diseases, and compatibility with scion capable
   of producing fruits attractive to the market, has revolutionized fruit
   crops worldwide. However, the enormous potential of plants to be

   explored; it can be done based on knowledge about kinetic parameters
   such as Influx, Maximum uptake velocity, Constant ion affinity with the
   carrier, and Minimum concentration. The adaptation of a methodology
   elaborated for annual crops to set kinetic parameters, as well as the
   Brazilian development of the Influx software, enabled selecting not only
   peach rootstocks with different nutrient uptake capacities, but also
   observing the influence the grafting of a particular cultivar crown has
   on rootstock's ability to uptake a given nutrient from the soil. Thus,
   fruit tree rootstocks and cultivars can always be selected based on
   traits desired by fruit growers and consumers, with emphasis on yield
   and quality of fruits. They can also be more efficient in taking up

Abstract = {Arid and semiarid regions are vulnerable to water deficits and salinity.
   Citrus plants are sensitive to saline stress and require the use of
   tolerant scion-rootstock combinations. Thus, this study aimed to
   evaluate and classify citrus scion-rootstock combinations with respect
   to their tolerance to salinity during seedling formation in a protected

   rootstocks grafted with two scion varieties: `Tahiti' acid lime and
   `Star Ruby' grapefruit. The scion-rootstock combinations were evaluated
   for accumulated dry matter and survival index at 330 days after sowing
   the rootstocks. Salinity exerted different effects on the dry matter
   formation of scion-rootstock combinations. `Star Ruby' was less
   sensitive to salinity, particularly when the rootstocks were the hybrids
   from `Sunki of Florida' mandarin (TSKFL) with `Troyer' citrange (CTTR) -

   grapevines from propagation is the only possibility to control the
   spread of this disease. Consequently, sensitive, inexpensive and fast
   methods for the detection of this virus are needed. In the present
   study, a detection method for GFkV was developed employing reverse
   transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method
   to reverse transcribe viral RNA and amplify DNA in one step. Primers
   were designed to bind the coat protein gene. The RT-LAMP works without
   the need for time consuming RNA extraction. In contrast, a crude
   homogenate can be used directly to set up the RT-LAMP reaction.
   Sensitivity of RT-LAMP was compared to ELISA by diluting extracts from
   infected material in extracts prepared from healthy plants. While ELISA
   gave positive results for all undiluted samples and most samples diluted
   1:10, RT-LAMP was positive for all samples diluted up to 1:100 and gave
   a positive signal even after diluting 1:1.000.000 in most cases. Thus,
   it is possible to identify also those plants with lower virus titers,
   which then can be excluded from further propagation.},

Title = {Candidate genes and SNPs associated with stomatal conductance under
   drought stress in Vitis},
Journal = {BMC PLANT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {Background: Understanding the complexity of the vine plant's response to
   water deficit represents a major challenge for sustainable winegrowing.
   Regulation of water use requires a coordinated action between scions and
   rootstocks on which cultivars are generally grafted to cope with
   phylloxera infestations. In this regard, a genome-wide association study
   (GWAS) approach was applied on an `ad hoc' association mapping panel
   including different Vitis species, in order to dissect the genetic basis
   of transpiration-related traits and to identify genomic regions of grape
   rootstocks associated with drought tolerance mechanisms.
   The panel was genotyped with the GrapeReSeq Illumina 20 K SNP array and
   SSR markers, and infrared thermography was applied to estimate stomatal
   conductance values during progressive water deficit.
   Results: In the association panel the level of genetic diversity was
   substantially lower for SNPs loci (0.32) than for SSR (0.87). GWAS
   detected 24 significant marker-trait associations along the various
   stages of drought-stress experiment and 13 candidate genes with a
   feasible role in drought response were identified.
   Gene expression analysis proved that three of these genes
   (VIT\_13s0019g03040, VIT\_17s0000g08960, VIT\_18s0001g15390) were
   actually induced by drought stress.
   Genetic variation of VIT\_17s0000g08960 coding for a raffinose synthase
   was further investigated by resequencing the gene of 85 individuals
   since a SNP located in the region (chr17\_10,497,222\_C\_T) was
   significantly associated with stomatal conductance.
   Conclusions: Our results represent a step forward towards the dissection
   of genetic basis that modulate the response to water deprivation in
   grape rootstocks. The knowledge derived from this study may be useful to
   exploit genotypic and phenotypic diversity in practical applications and
   to assist further investigations.},

Title = {Epigenetic Changes and Transcriptional Reprogramming Upon Woody Plant
   Grafting for Crop Sustainability in a Changing Environment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {Plant grafting is an ancient agricultural practice widely employed in
   crops such as woody fruit trees, grapes, and vegetables, in order to
   improve plant performance. Successful grafting requires the interaction
   of compatible scion and rootstock genotypes. This involves an intricate
   network of molecular mechanisms operating at the graft junction and
   associated with the development and the physiology of the scion,
   ultimately leading to improved agricultural characteristics such as
   fruit quality and increased tolerance/resistance to abiotic and biotic
   factors. Bidirectional transfer of molecular signals such as hormones,
   nutrients, proteins, and nucleic acids from the rootstock to the scion
   and vice versa have been well documented. In recent years, studies on
   rootstock-scion interactions have proposed the existence of an
   epigenetic component in grafting reactions. Epigenetic changes such as
   DNA methylation, histone modification, and the action of small RNA
   molecules are known to modulate chromatin architecture, leading to gene
   expression changes and impacting cellular function. Mobile small RNAs
   (siRNAs) migrating across the graft union from the rootstock to the
   scion and vice versa mediate modifications in the DNA methylation
   pattern of the recipient partner, leading to altered chromatin structure
   and transcriptional reprogramming. Moreover, graft-induced DNA
   methylation changes and gene expression shifts in the scion have been
   associated with variations in graft performance. If these changes are
   heritable they can lead to stably altered phenotypes and affect
   important agricultural traits, making grafting an alternative to
   breeding for the production of superior plants with improved traits.
   However, most reviews on the molecular mechanisms underlying this
   process comprise studies related to vegetable grafting. In this review
   we will provide a comprehensive presentation of the current knowledge on
   the epigenetic changes and transcriptional reprogramming associated with
   the rootstock-scion interaction focusing on woody plant species,
   including the recent findings arising from the employment of
   advanced-omics technologies as well as transgrafting methodologies and
   their potential exploitation for generating superior quality grafts in
   woody species. Furthermore, will discuss graft-induced heritable
   epigenetic changes leading to novel plant phenotypes and their
   implication to woody crop improvement for yield, quality, and stress
   resilience, within the context of climate change.},

Title = {Nitrate Uptake and Transport Properties of Two Grapevine Rootstocks With
   Varying Vigor},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 18},
Abstract = {In viticulture, rootstocks are essential to cope with edaphic
   constraints. They can also be used to modulate scion growth and
   development to help improve berry yield and quality. The rootstock
   contribution to scion growth is not fully understood. Since nitrogen (N)
   is a significant driver of grapevine growth, rootstock properties
   associated with N uptake and transport may play a key role in the growth
   potential of grafted grapevines. We evaluated N uptake and transport in
   a potted system using two grapevines rootstocks {[}Riparia Gloire (RG)
   and 1103 Paulsen (1103P)] grafted to Pinot noir (Pommard clone) scion.
   Combining results of nitrate induction and steady-state experiments at
   two N availability levels, we observed different responses in the uptake
   and utilization of N between the two rootstocks. The low vigor rootstock
   (RG) exhibited greater nitrate uptake capacity and nitrate assimilation
   in roots after nitrate resupply than the more vigorous 1103P rootstock.
   This behavior may be attributed to a greater root carbohydrate status
   observed in RG for both experiments. However, 1103P demonstrated a
   higher N translocation rate to shoots regardless of N availability.
   These distinct rootstock behaviors resulted in significant differences
   in biomass allocation between roots and shoots under N-limited
   conditions, although the overall vine biomass was not different. Under
   sufficient N supply, differences between rootstocks decreased but 1103P
   stored more N in roots, which may benefit growth in subsequent growing
   seasons. Overall, greater transpiration of vines grafted to 1103P
   rootstock causing higher N translocation to shoots could partially
   explain its known growth-promoting effect to scions under low and high N
   availability, whereas the low vigor typically conferred to scions by RG
   may result from the combination of lower N translocation to shoots and a
   greater allocation of biomass toward roots when N is low.},

Abstract = {Diversity and community structure of soil microorganisms are
   increasingly recognized as important contributors to sustainable
   agriculture and plant health. In viticulture, grapevine scion cultivars
   are grafted onto rootstocks to reduce the incidence of the grapevine
   pest phylloxera. However, it is unknown to what extent this practice
   influences root-associated microbial communities. A field survey of
   bacteria in soil surrounding the roots (rhizosphere) of 4 cultivars x 4
   rootstock combinations was conducted to determine whether rootstock and
   cultivar genotypes are important drivers of rhizosphere community
   diversity and composition. Differences in alpha-diversity was highly
   dependent on rootstock-cultivar combinations, while bacterial community
   structure primarily clustered according to cultivar differences,
   followed by differences in rootstocks. Twenty-four bacterial indicator
   genera were significantly more abundant in one or more cultivars, while
   only thirteen were found to be specifically associated with one or more
   rootstock genotypes, but there was little overlap between cultivar and
   rootstock indicator genera. Bacterial diversity in grafted grapevines
   was affected by both cultivar and rootstock identity, but this effect
   was dependent on which diversity measure was being examined (i.e.,
   alpha- or beta-diversity) and specific rootstock-cultivar combinations.
   These findings could have functional implications, for instance, if
   specific combinations varied in their ability to attract beneficial
   microbial taxa which can control pathogens and/or assist plant
   performance.},

   Responses of the Scion under Water Deficit Condition},

Abstract = {Grapevine rootstocks play a pivotal role in plant responses to water
   deficiency (WD); therefore, the selection of new genotypes is a
   promising strategy for future agricultural managements aimed to cope
   with climate changes. Recent studies reinforced the central role of the
   root system in modulating WD responses, as it not only controls water
   uptake and transport to the leaves, but it also participates in stress
   perception and stress signalling to the shoot. The present work
   evaluated the performance of the 101.14 and M4 rootstocks in graft
   combination with the cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon (Cab) by assessing some
   of the canonical molecular, biochemical and physiological responses
   induced by WD. The autograft Cab/Cab was also included in the
   experimental design as a control. Under WD, Cab/M4 showed a greater
   capacity to sustain CO2 assimilation rate (A(n)) and stomatal
   conductance (g(s)), while limiting the decrease of leaf potential
   (Psi(leaf)) compared with the other graft combinations. The enhanced
   adaptability of Cab/M4 to WD was also supported by the higher uptake of
   water from the soil, estimated by measuring the daily water lost of
   plants, and by the reduced effect of the drought treatment on the total
   root biomass. Quantification of ABA in both root and leaf organs
   revealed a reduced accumulation in Cab/M4 plants, thus confirming the
   lower sensitivity of the Cab/M4 combination to water deficit. At the
   molecular level, the expression of selected stress-responsive
   ABA-related genes was investigated, including genes involved in ABA
   biosynthesis (VviNCED3), ABA signalling (VviPP2C9, VviPP2C4,
   VviSnRk2.6), regulation of gene expression (VviABF2) and stomatal
   opening (VviSIRK, VviMYB60). Results indicated a tight correlation
   between the level of gene expression and of ABA accumulation in roots
   and leaves, suggesting that ABA synthesis and signalling were attenuated
   in Cab/M4 as compared with Cab/101.14 and Cab/Cab. As a whole, our data
   demonstrated the capacity of M4 to satisfy the water demand of the scion
   under limited water availability, as revealed by delayed stomatal
   closure and higher photosynthetic activity. Importantly, these
   physiological adaptive traits related to attenuated ABA-mediated
   responses in roots and leaves.},

Title = {Molecular Tools for Adapting Viticulture to Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Adaptation of viticulture to climate change includes exploration of new
   geographical areas, new training systems, new management practices, or
   new varieties, both for rootstocks and scions. Molecular tools can be
   defined as molecular approaches used to study DNAs, RNAs, and proteins
   in all living organisms. We present here the current knowledge about
   molecular tools and their potential usefulness in three aspects of
   grapevine adaptation to the ongoing climate change. (i) Molecular tools
   for understanding grapevine response to environmental stresses. A fine
   description of the regulation of gene expression is a powerful tool to
   understand the physiological mechanisms set up by the grapevine to
   respond to abiotic stress such as high temperatures or drought. The
   current knowledge on gene expression is continuously evolving with
   increasing evidence of the role of alternative splicing, small RNAs,
   long non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation, or chromatin activity. (ii)
   Genetics and genomics of grapevine stress tolerance. The description of
   the grapevine genome is more and more precise. The genetic variations
   among genotypes are now revealed with new technologies with the
   sequencing of very long DNA molecules. High throughput technologies for
   DNA sequencing also allow now the genetic characterization at the same
   time of hundreds of genotypes for thousands of points in the genome,
   which provides unprecedented datasets for genotype-phenotype
   associations studies. We review the current knowledge on the genetic
   determinism of traits for the adaptation to climate change. We focus on
   quantitative trait loci and molecular markers available for
   developmental stages, tolerance to water stress/water use efficiency,
   sugar content, acidity, and secondary metabolism of the berries. (iii)
   Controlling the genome and its expression to allow breeding of
   better-adapted genotypes. High-density DNA genotyping can be used to
   select genotypes with specific interesting alleles but genomic selection
   is also a powerful method able to take into account the genetic
   information along the whole genome to predict a phenotype. Modern
   technologies are also able to generate mutations that are possibly
   interesting for generating new phenotypes but the most promising one is
   the direct editing of the genome at a precise location.},

Title = {Identifying roles of the scion and the rootstock in regulating plant
   development and functioning under different phosphorus supplies in
   grapevine},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {185},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Phosphorus is essential for plant life and plants have developed
   numerous strategies to maximise phosphate (Pi) acquisition and use under
   limited Pi supply. Here we have used reciprocal grafting to determine
   whether the shoot and root have different roles in regulating some of
   these strategies. Reciprocal grafts of two grapevine genotypes (Vitis
   vinifera cv. Pinot noir and V. berlandieri x V. rupestris cv. 1103
   Paulsen) were produced as well as the corresponding homo-graft controls;
   the plants were grown in hydroponic culture and subjected to two levels
   of Pi supply (high (0.6 mM) or low (0.001 mM)). Biomass accumulation,
   root morphology, and root, stem and leaf organic acid, phosphate,
   nitrate and sulphate concentrations were measured. The transcript
   abundance of orthologues of known phosphate starvation induced (PSI)
   genes from Arabidopsis was also quantified. Under high Pi, the scion
   genotype had a large impact on plant growth, but the morphology of roots
   (such as root tip density) was not affected. Low Pi supply affected
   growth, tissue organic acid concentration, the activity of acid
   phosphatases released by the roots and the expression of PSI genes.
   Rootstock genotypes showed differences in root responses to low Pi
   supply, but the scion also exerted long-distance regulation of rootstock
   responses to low Pi, for example, modifying PSI gene expression,
   sulphate acquisition efficiency, the activity of acid phosphatases
   released by the roots and root organic acid concentrations. This work
   shows for the first time that the grapevine genotypes differ in their
   response to low Pi supply and that the scion can modify rootstock
   responses to the nutrient availability. This work highlights that
   genetic variation in shoot-borne signals can regulate root responses to
   Pi supply and that understanding rootstock responses to the environment
   must be done considering scion influence.},

Journal = {SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {To investigate the dwarfing effect of candidate rootstocks on persimmon
   (Diospyros kaki Thunb.), we compared the growth of `Fuyu' scions grafted
   onto `Flourakudai' and 522 clone dwarfing rootstocks with that on a
   standard D. kaki rootstock, `Aogaki' seedlings, in unpruned and
   non-bearing trees. In addition, we compared the growth, fruit quality,
   and yield efficiency of `Fuyu' scions grafted onto three candidate
   dwarfing rootstocks ('Hourakudai', No. 3, and 522 clones) with those of
   `Aogaki' seedlings grown under conventional cultivation (pruned and
   fruited). In unpruned and non-bearing trees, grafts on 522 and
   `Flourakudai' rootstocks reached about 75 \% of the height of trees on
   the standard rootstock. Tree canopy volumes on the 522 and `Flourakudai'
   rootstocks were about 67 \% and 42 \%, respectively, of those on the
   standard rootstock. The high positive correlation between TCSA and tree
   canopy volume was observed for not only between trees grown under
   unpruned and nonbearing but also trees grown under pruned and bearing.
   Tree canopy volume was a better indicator of dwarfing capacity of
   rootstocks than tree height or tree canopy area. In conventional
   cultivation, trees grafted on all three candidate dwarfing rootstocks
   had smaller canopy area and canopy volume than those grafted onto the
   standard rootstock, from 2 to 11 years after planting. Although
   differences in tree growth between the three dwarf rootstocks were
   observed, the differences tended to decrease as tree age advanced. The
   quality of fruit produced (fruit weight, soluble solids content, and
   skin color) by trees on dwarf rootstocks did not differ from that
   produced on standard rootstocks, although annual variations occurred.
   Trees on 522 rootstock had the lowest yield owing to decreased vigor.
   Trees on `Flourakudai' rootstock had the highest yield efficiency per
   trunk cross-sectional area of scions and per tree canopy volume.
   `Flourakudai' softwood cuttings showed the highest rooting rate (80 \%).
   These results identify `Flourakudai' as a promising new rootstock for
   growing dwarfed `Fuyu' trees, owing to the high yield efficiency without
   a decrease in fruit quality.},

Title = {The shapes of wine and table grape leaves: An ampelometric study

Abstract = {Societal Impact Statement
   Leaf shapes are critical to the identification of grapevine varieties.
   Historically, measures of grapevine leaves were used to enforce
   appellation law and leaf shape is used to this day to distinguish
   economically important clones that genetic analyses fail to
   discriminate. The ampelometry ({''}vine{''} + ``process of
   measuring{''}) of Pierre Galet (1921-2019), through quantitative
   measurements and hand-drawings, illuminated the beauty of grapevine
   diversity for the world. Here, mathematical methods rigorously
   quantifying hand-drawings of grapevine leaves are presented, with
   implications for how we document and preserve the stunning diversity of
   plants we so readily see with our eyes.
   Summary
   People have an innate ability to recognize different patterns in among
   plants. Quantifying these differences, that we assimilate so
   effortlessly with our senses, is more challenging. Grapevines are a
   special case in which leaf shape has been critical to identify varieties
   correctly. The distinct morphology of grapevine leaves lends itself to
   the application of mathematical approaches that quantify shape. Here,
   corresponding points on every grapevine leaf (landmarks) and equidistant
   points between landmarks (pseudo-landmarks) were used to capture
   intricate, local features in grapevine leaves: the curvature of veins,
   lobes, and sinuses and the shapes of serrations. Using these points,
   averaged leaf shapes for 60 varieties of wine and table grapes were
   calculated that quantify shape to the same resolution as hand drawings.
   The overall morphological similarity of each variety to the other
   classified the leaves into two discrete groups: (i) deeply lobed and
   (ii) more entire-corresponding to the measurements of sinus depth put
   forward by the ampelographer Pierre Galet. Using the system of Galet,
   landmarks, and pseudo-landmarks were converted into relative distance
   and angle measurements. Using a high number of landmarks and
   pseudolandmarks increased the accuracy of predicting variety correctly,
   compared to using a finite number of landmarks alone. The ability to
   identify correctly a vine variety from leaf shape will have significant
   implications for the wine industry, from ensuring correct scion and
   rootstock plantings in vineyards, to enforcing appellation law to
   discerning clones that are genetically indistinguishable.},

Abstract = {Under the current and future climate crisis, a significant rise in soil
   salinity will likely affect vine productivity in several Mediterranean
   regions. During the present research, the rootstock effects on salinity
   tolerance of Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapevine cultivars were studied.
   In a pot hydroponic culture, own-rooted Merlot and Cabernet Franc
   grapevine cultivars or grafted onto the rootstocks 1103 P and 101-14 Mgt
   were drip-irrigated with saline water. A completely randomized 3 x 2 x 2
   factorial experiment was designed with two vine rootstocks or own-rooted
   vines, two scion cultivars, and 100 mM NaCl salinity or control
   treatments, with six replications. A significant effect of scion
   cultivar, rootstock, and salinity was observed for most of the measured
   parameters. At the end of salinity stress period, leaf, shoot, root, and
   trunk nutrient concentrations were measured. Salinity stress increased
   Chloride (Cl) and Sodium (Na) concentrations in all parts of the vines
   and decreased leaf concentrations of Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca),
   Magnesium (Mg), Nitrogen (N), and Iron (Fe). In contrast, salinity
   stress increased leaf Boron (B) concentrations, whereas that of
   Manganese (Mn) remained unaffected. Leaf chlorophyll concentration
   decreased from 42\% to 40\% after thirty and sixty days of salt
   treatment, respectively. A similar trend was observed for the CCM-200
   relative chlorophyll content. Salinity significantly decreased steam
   water potential (Ws), net CO2 assimilation rate (A), and stomatal
   conductance (g(s)) in all cases of grafted or own-rooted vines. Sixty
   days after the beginning of salt treatment, total Phenolics and PSII
   maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) decreased significantly. The rootstock
   1103 P seems to be a better excluder for Na and Cl and more tolerant to
   salinity compared to 101-14 Mgt rootstock.},

Abstract = {Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are a serious and growing threat to
   vineyards worldwide. The need for innovative control tools persists
   since pesticides used against some GTDs have been banned and only
   methods to prevent infections or to reduce foliar symptoms have been
   developed so far. In this context, the application of imaging methods,
   already applied to study plant-microbe interactions, represents an
   interesting approach to understand the effect of experimental treatments
   applied to reduce fungal colonization, on GTD-related pathogens
   activity. To this aim, trials were carried out to evaluate the efficacy
   of copper-based treatments, formulated with hydroxyapatite (HA) as
   co-adjuvant with innovative delivery properties, loaded with two
   different copper(II) compounds (tribasic sulfate and sulfate
   pentahydrate), and applied to grapevine propagation material to inhibit
   fungal wood colonization. The treated rootstock (Vitis berlandieri x
   Vitis riparia cv. K5BB) and scion cuttings (Vitis vinifera L., cv.
   Chardonnay) had been inoculated with a strain of Phaeoacremonium minimum
   (Pmi) compared to uninoculated rootstocks. Experimental treatments were
   applied during the water-soaking process, comparing the copper(II)
   compounds pure or formulated with HA, to hydrate the cuttings. After
   callusing, grafted vines were grown under greenhouse conditions in a
   nursery and inoculated with Pmi::gfp7 or with Pmi wild-type. Fifteen
   weeks post-inoculation, woody tissues close to the inoculation site were
   sampled to evaluate the efficiency of the treatments by studying the
   plant-microbe interaction by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).
   Copper and further elements were also quantified in the same tissues
   immediately after the treatments and on the CLSM samples. Finally, the
   grapevine defense responses were studied in the leaves of cuttings
   treated with the same formulations. The present investigation confirmed
   the relevant interaction of Pmi and the related transformed strain on
   the vascular tissues of grafted vines. Furthermore, in vitro assay
   revealed (i) the fungistatic effect of HA and the reduced effect of Cu
   fungicide when combined with HA. In planta assays showed (ii) the
   reduction of Pmi infection in propagation material treated with HA-Cu
   formulations, (iii) the movement of HA-Cu formulations inside the plant
   tissues and their persistence over time, and (iv) the plant defense
   reaction following the treatment with pure HA or Cu, or combined.},

Abstract = {Salinity, which is predominantly an issue for agricultural systems in
   arid and semi-arid regions, has the potential to impair grape production
   and wine quality, and its impact on the grape and wine industries is
   predicted to increase with climate change. Research on the physiological
   and molecular changes that occur in salt-affected vines has unveiled
   complex osmotic and ionic responses that include oxidative stress, water
   loss, photoinhibition, growth inhibition and necrosis. Proposed salt
   tolerance mechanisms include elevated antioxidant production, hydric
   regulation and salt exclusion from shoots and berries. These later of
   these mechanisms is found in certain Vitis genotypes that, when grafted
   as rootstocks, can protect fruit-bearing scions from accumulating
   significant amounts of saline ions from soils, most notably through the
   presence of specific transport proteins that are involved in regulating
   the transfer of ions from root to shoot via the xylem. Significant gaps
   in knowledge remain, however, regarding salt tolerance mechanisms for
   Vitis species, with many mechanisms inferred from other species or
   documented only at the level of gene expression. A better understanding
   of the mechanisms that confer salt tolerance in Vitis species is needed
   to improve the production of new germplasm that is locally adapted and
   better suited to the challenges of a changing climate. Hence, this
   review covers the current knowledge on the characteristics that are
   associated with salt damage and tolerance in grapevine cultivars and
   rootstocks and highlights possible future avenues that will enable
   development of new options for the industry to combat salinity.},

Abstract = {Grape growers use rootstocks to provide protection against pests and

   Our study examined two grapevine scion varieties ('Chardonnay' and
   `Cabernet Sauvignon') grafted to 15 different rootstocks and determined
   the effect of rootstocks on eight traits important to viticulture. We
   assessed the vines across five years and identified both year and
   variety as contributing strongly to trait variation. The effect of
   rootstock was relatively consistent across years and varieties,
   explaining between 8.99\% and 9.78\% of the variation in growth-related
   traits including yield, pruning weight, berry weight and Ravaz index
   (yield to pruning weight ratio). Increases in yield due to rootstock
   were generally the result of increases in berry weight, likely due to
   increased water uptake by vines grafted to a particular rootstock. We
   demonstrated a greater than 50\% increase in yield, pruning weight, or
   Ravaz index by choosing the optimal rootstock, indicating that rootstock
   choice is crucial for grape growers looking to improve vine performance.},

Abstract = {Phylloxera is one of the most invasive and widespread insects in
   viticulture. An increase in populations feeding on leaves and/or roots
   of formeR + Ly resistant grapevines has been observed, but information
   on leaf and whole plant phylloxera infestation effects is lacking. We
   monitored the water and carbon metabolism of vines (one rootstock x
   scion combination) inoculated with insects' eggs on leaves (L) or both
   leaves and roots (R+L). Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) in infested
   and noninfested tissue of different organs and plant biomass were
   measured at the end of the experiment. At the peak of the biotic stress
   treatment, the plants reduced transpiration by about 30\% compared to
   control, while photosynthesis remained unaffected. Lower soluble NSC
   were measured in infested than in the nearby noninfested tissue of both
   L and R+L groups, suggesting sugar consumption by the insect, while
   infested roots increased starch content by fivefold. NSC were depleted
   in noninfested roots of R+L plants as well, giving strength to the
   hypothesis of intense metabolites translocation in favor of the insect.
   A more distinct physiological depression in R+L vines compared to L was
   highlighted, even if the total biomass reduction was more marked in L
   plants. Our preliminary results suggest that the insect reprograms plant
   metabolism stimulating a more conservative water use, while competing

Abstract = {In viticulture, grafting is used to propagate Phylloxera-susceptible

   Although scion-rootstock reciprocal signaling is essential for the
   formation of a proper vascular union and for coordinated growth, our
   knowledge of graft partner interactions is very limited. In order to
   elucidate the scale and the content of scion-rootstock metabolic
   interactions, we profiled the metabolome of eleven graft combination in
   leaves, stems, and phloem exudate from both above and below the graft
   union 5-6 months after grafting. We compared the metabolome of scions
   vs. rootstocks of homografts vs. heterografts and investigated the
   reciprocal effect of the rootstock on the scion metabolome. This
   approach revealed that (1) grafting has a minor impact on the metabolome
   of grafted grapevines when tissues and genotypes were compared, (2)
   heterografting affects rootstocks more than scions, (3) the presence of
   a heterologous grafting partner increases defense-related compounds in
   both scion and rootstocks in shorter and longer distances from the
   graft, and (4) leaves were revealed as the best tissue to search for

Abstract = {Grapevine leafroll-associated virus (GLRaV) infections are accompanied

   which individual or combination of GLRaVs is present. Using a dedicated
   experimental vineyard, we studied the responses to GLRaVs in ripening
   berries from Cabernet Franc grapevines grafted to different rootstocks
   and with zero, one, or pairs of leafroll infection(s). RNA sequencing
   data were mapped to a high-quality Cabernet Franc genome reference
   assembled to carry out this study and integrated with hormone and
   metabolite abundance data. This study characterized conserved and
   condition-dependent responses to GLRaV infection(s). Common responses to
   GLRaVs were reproduced in two consecutive years and occurred in plants
   grafted to different rootstocks in more than one infection condition.
   Though different infections were inconsistently distinguishable from one
   another, the effects of infections in plants grafted to different
   rootstocks were distinct at each developmental stage. Conserved
   responses included the modulation of genes related to pathogen
   detection, abscisic acid (ABA) signalling, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis,
   and cytoskeleton remodelling. ABA, ABA glucose ester, ABA and hormone
   signalling-related gene expression, and the expression of genes in
   several transcription factor families differentiated the effects of
   GLRaVs in berries from Cabernet Franc grapevines grafted to different
   rootstocks. These results support that ABA participates in the shared
   responses to GLRaV infection and differentiates the responses observed
   in grapevines grafted to different rootstocks.},

   and 20\% of CaSa (H) rootstocks micrografted with CaSa (VI) and with Ch
   (VI) scions, respectively, 12 weeks after micrografting. The rootstock
   CaSa (H) that had been micrografted with CaSa (VI) and Ch (VI) scions
   for 5 weeks was subsequently cultured on half-strength Murashige and

   (H) and 85\% of micrografts Ch (VI)/CaSa (H) after 5 weeks of salt
   stress. Reddish-purple leaf coloration and downward rolling were
   observed in CaSa (H) rootstocks that were micrografted with CaSa (VI)
   scions, while leaf downward rolling and yellowing were seen in CaSa (H)
   rootstocks that were micrografted with Ch (VI) scions.

Title = {Grape Phylloxera Genetic Structure Reveals Root-Leaf Migration within
   Commercial Vineyards},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary In most wine regions around the world, commercial
   vineyards are planted with Vitis vinifera scions grafted on grape
   phylloxera-tolerating rootstocks. Root-feeding phylloxera populations
   still thrive on such rootstocks and occasionally leaf-feeding phylloxera
   populations are observed. The cause for these foliar infestations is
   thought to reside at the thickets of abandoned rootstock vines that grow
   on the risers of vineyard terraces and constitute a different habitat
   with large leaf-feeding populations. Besides, it is unclear if root and
   leaf populations within commercial vineyards are genetically connected,
   which may indicate a process of adaption that could lead to large foliar
   phylloxera populations and better-adapted phylloxera biotypes. To shed
   light on these issues, phylloxera root- and leaf-feeding larvae from
   commercial vineyards and larvae from nearby thickets were genetically
   compared, focusing on population structure and genetic association. Our
   study showed that foliar populations in commercial vineyards not only
   originate from leaf-feeding populations on nearby abandoned rootstock
   vines, but also from root populations within the vineyard. The results
   suggest that sexual recombination is rare in the study area and that
   direct root-leaf migration creates population bottlenecks based on
   founder effects or host plant adaption. Depending on their life cycle,
   grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch) leaf-feeding
   populations are initiated through asexually produced offspring or sexual
   recombination. The vine's initial foliar larvae may originate from
   root-feeding phylloxera or wind-drifted foliar larvae from other
   habitats. Though some studies have reported phylloxera leaf-feeding in
   commercial vineyards, it is still unclear if they are genetically
   distinct from the population structure of these two sources. Using seven
   SSR-markers, this study analyzed the genetic structure of phylloxera
   populations in commercial vineyards with different natural infestation
   scenarios and that of single-plant insect systems that exclude
   infestation by wind-drifted larvae. We saw that during the vegetation
   period, phylloxera populations predominately go through their asexual
   life cycle to migrate from roots to leaves. We provided evidence that
   such migrations do not exclusively occur through wind-drifted foliar
   populations from rootstock vines in abandoned thickets, but that root
   populations within commercial vineyards also migrate to establish V.
   vinifera leaf populations. Whereas the former scenario generates foliar
   populations with high genotypic diversity, the latter produces
   population bottlenecks through founder effects or phylloxera biotype
   selection pressure. We finally compared these population structures with
   those of populations in their native habitat in North America, using
   four microsatellite markers.},

Abstract = {In response to increasing concerns over climate change, soil health and
   wine quality, grape growers are seeking new practices (e.g., biochar
   application) to minimize their environmental footprint while increasing
   productivity and the quality of their products. To explore the potential
   of biochar-based amendments to achieve these goals in wine grape
   production, vineyard trials were established in the fall of 2018. Two
   Oregon sites were chosen with distinct soil types and climates
   (Willamette Valley and Rogue Valley) but planted with the same grapevine
   scion/rootstock Pinot noir combination. Four treatments were applied
   under vines at each location: no biochar-no tillage (NT); no biochar +
   tillage (B0); 18 tons ha(-1) biochar + tillage (B18); 35 tons ha(-1)
   biochar + tillage (B35). In 2019, a suite of soil health, plant, and
   crop variables were measured, and wines were produced after harvest. The
   incorporation of biochar modified the chemical and physical composition
   of soils at the two studied locations, increasing the bioavailability of
   carbon and nitrogen, their gravimetric water content and the
   concentration of plant available micro and macro nutrients. No responses
   of plant physiology parameters or productivity at either site were found
   after biochar incorporation when compared with controls. Conversely, a
   significant and gradual decrease in the amount of wine tannins was found
   as a result of biochar application in wines produced from grapes from
   the Woodhall location. Long-term field experiments are required to
   assess the effects of biochar on soil properties, vine physiology,
   productivity, and grape and wine quality several years after
   incorporation.},

Title = {The Quality of Superior Seedless Bunches during Shelf Life as Determined

Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Vineyard rootstocks are an important tool in the local and international
   market for growing the Superior Seedless grape cultivar, which is highly
   favored by customers. As a result, it is vital to pay close attention to
   the quality of clusters during handling. The current study aimed to
   determine whether Superior Seedless vines can be grown on specific
   rootstocks, resulting in higher quality during shelf life. Vines of the
   Superior Seedless vine cultivar that were used were 13 years old and had
   been grown on sandy soil. These vines were grafted onto four different
   rootstocks (genotypes), namely Freedom, 1103 Paulsen, SO4, and Own Root.
   The soluble solids content (SSC\%) was selected as 16\%. Bunches were
   subsequently stored in the lab at 27 +/- 1 degrees C with 57 +/- 3\% air
   relative humidity for three days. Rootstock 1103 Paulsen's quality was
   found to be superior to that of the other rootstocks, according to the
   results of the study. Rootstock 1103 Paulsen maintained its ascorbic
   acid (AA) content, which is reflected in its antioxidant capacity,
   according to the results. In addition, lipid peroxidation accumulation
   and ion leakage percentages indicated that oxidative reactions were at
   their lowest levels. The results show that 1103 Paulsen decreases
   cellular metabolism enzyme activities at the shelf life level and
   improves the bunch quality of Superior Seedless (scion) grapes within 4
   days of application. As a whole, the results show that the 1103 Paulsen
   rootstock produces Superior Seedless bunches of a high quality that is
   preserved throughout the shelf life period.},

Title = {Effect of Rootstock on Citrus Fruit Quality: A Review},
Journal = {FOOD REVIEWS INTERNATIONAL},
Abstract = {Citrus rootstocks are a relevant tree part that contributes to crops
   adapting to biotic and abiotic conditions, it becoming a key factor to
   face the current era of climate change. Although the emphasis of most
   studies on rootstocks has been placed on the yield and optimization of
   the citrus fruit grown in different environments, other studies have
   paid attention to the effect of rootstock on fruit quality. Hence, the
   quality of citrus fruit is becoming increasingly more relevant as
   consumers demand high internal and external qualities to eat citrus
   fruit fresh. To better understand how rootstock influences citrus fruit
   quality, the literature that focuses on physico-chemical parameters,
   nutritional compounds and physiological disorders has been revised. This
   review points out the influence that the external aspects surrounding
   plants has on fruit quality, such as the rootstock/scion interaction,
   the water uptake capacity of roots, the modification of the
   photosynthetic rate or availability of nutrient minerals.},

   Selection},
Journal = {HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The production and quality of grapes are determined by the hydric and
   nutritional status of the vine. In modern viticulture, the interface
   between grapevine and soil is represented by the rootstock, which
   modulates the uptake of water and nutrients. Thus, selection of new
   rootstocks for abiotic stress tolerance represents an adaptation
   strategy for viticulture to the new environmental conditions imposed by
   climate change. The aim of this work is to evaluate the water-use
   efficiency (WUE) and the nutritional status of a selection of 30 new
   rootstock genotypes, originating from several breeding programs. WUE and
   gas exchange were measured for each genotype in two environments
   characterized by different water availability, and the levels of N, P,
   K, Mg, Ca, Na, Fe, Mn, and Zn in the leaf blades were determined during
   the phenological stages of flowering and ripening. Water availability
   was different in the two environments, affecting gas exchange, with mean
   values of carbon assimilation of 10.43 +/- 0.32 and 3.84 +/- 0.34 mu mol
   CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Genotypes were classified according to
   their water stress tolerance, vigor, and affinity for macronutrients and
   micronutrients. A total of 14 genotypes showed tolerance to water
   stress, and 10 of them reported high vigor and carbon assimilation.
   Furthermore, the majority of water-stress-tolerant genotypes had greater
   affinity for Mg than for K. In further studies, the most promising
   rootstocks will be evaluated in grafting combination with Vitis
   vinifera.},

Abstract = {Dieback and canker of young stone fruit trees can cause suboptimal
   growth and even death under severe conditions. One source of inoculum of
   canker pathogens could be through nursery trees harboring latent
   infections that would not be visible to inspections done according to
   the deciduous fruit scheme. The objectives of this study were to
   identify the canker and wood rot fungal pathogens present in nursery
   stone fruit trees as well as in propagation material and to evaluate
   their pathogenicity. Isolations were made from scion and rootstock
   propagation material and from certified nursery stone fruit trees. The
   plant material sampled did not have any external symptoms. The certified
   nursery trees when cross-sectioned displayed brown discoloration from
   the pruning wound, the bud union, and often the crown. Fungal species
   isolated were identified by sequencing of the relevant barcoding genes
   and phylogenetic analyses thereof. Canker- and wood rot-associated fungi
   were identified. Buds used for budding had low levels of infection, with
   1.2\% of dormant buds infected and 0.4\% of green buds infected. The
   dormant rootstock shoots had a canker pathogen incidence of 6.2\% before
   they were planted in the nursery fields and increased inasmuch as the
   ungrafted, rooted rootstock plants had 11.1\% infection with canker and
   wood rot pathogens. Out of 1,080 nursery trees, the canker- and wood
   rot-associated fungi infected 21.8\% of trees. The canker-causing
   pathogens that were isolated the most were Cadophora luteo olivacea and
   Diplodia seriata. A low incidence of wood rot fungi was found, with only
   1.5\% of nursery trees infected. In total, 26 new reports of fungal
   species on stone fruit in South Africa were made. Of these, 22 have not
   been found on stone fruit worldwide. The pathogenicity trials' results
   confirmed the pathogenic status of these newly reported species. All of
   the isolates tested formed lesions significantly longer than the
   control, 4 months after wound inoculation of 2-year-old shoots of two
   plum orchards. Lasiodiplodia theobromae was the most virulent species on
   both plum cultivars. The results of this research showed that nursery
   stone fruit trees and propagation material can harbor latent infections.
   Different management practices need to be evaluated to prevent these
   infections to ensure healthier stone fruit nursery trees.},

Volume = {129},
Number = {4},
Pages = {389-402},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Background and Aims Living root tissues significantly constrain plant
   water uptake under drought, but we lack functional traits to feasibly
   screen diverse plants for variation in the drought responses of these
   tissues. Water stress causes roots to lose volume and turgor, which are
   crucial to root structure, hydraulics and growth. Thus, we hypothesized
   that root pressure-volume (p-v) curve traits, which quantify the effects
   of water potential on bulk root turgor and volume, would capture
   differences in rootstock drought tolerance. Methods We used a greenhouse
   experiment to evaluate relationships between root p-v curve traits and
   gas exchange, whole-plant hydraulic conductance and biomass under
   drought for eight grapevine rootstocks that varied widely in drought
   performance in field trials (101-14, 110R, 420A, 5C, 140-Ru, 1103P,
   Ramsey and Riparia Gloire), grafted to the same scion variety (Vitis
   vinifera `Chardonnay'). Key Results The traits varied significantly
   across rootstocks, and droughted vines significantly reduced root turgor
   loss point (pi(tlp)), osmotic potential at full hydration (pi(o)) and
   capacitance (C), indicating that roots became less susceptible to turgor
   loss and volumetric shrinkage. Rootstocks that retained a greater root
   volume (i.e. a lower C) also maintained more gas exchange under drought.
   The rootstocks that previous field trials have classified as drought
   tolerant exhibited significantly lower pi(tlp), pi(o) and C values in
   well-watered conditions, but significantly higher pi(o) and pi(tlp)
   values under water stress, than the varieties classified as drought
   sensitive. Conclusions These findings suggest that acclimation in root
   p-v curve traits improves gas exchange in persistently dry conditions,
   potentially through impacts on root hydraulics or root to shoot chemical
   signalling. However, retaining turgor and volume in previously
   unstressed roots, as these roots deplete wet soil to moderately negative
   water potentials, could be more important to drought performance in the
   deep, highly heterogenous rooting zones which grapevines develop under
   field conditions.},

Abstract = {Background and Aims The use of rootstocks to enhance the performance of

   rootstocks (1103 Paulsen, Dog Ridge, Ramsey, Schwarzmann and SO4) were
   assessed over three seasons. Across all cultivars, yield of own roots,
   SO4 and Schwarzmann was similar. Ramsey and 1103 Paulsen produced a
   higher yield without a major effect on juice composition. Dog Ridge
   produced excessive vigour and poor grape composition. Across the
   scion-rootstock combinations, high vine vigour, yield and berry mass
   were associated with high juice pH, K+ and malic acid and low tartaric
   acid. Rootstock effects on juice K+, tartaric and malic acid were stable

Journal = {GIGASCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Modern biological approaches generate volumes of
   multi-dimensional data, offering unprecedented opportunities to address
   biological questions previously beyond reach owing to small or subtle
   effects. A fundamental question in plant biology is the extent to which
   below-ground activity in the root system influences above-ground
   phenotypes expressed in the shoot system. Grafting, an ancient
   horticultural practice that fuses the root system of one individual (the
   rootstock) with the shoot system of a second, genetically distinct
   individual (the scion), is a powerful experimental system to understand
   below-ground effects on above-ground phenotypes. Previous studies on
   grafted grapevines have detected rootstock influence on scion phenotypes
   including physiology and berry chemistry. However, the extent of the
   rootstock's influence on leaves, the photosynthetic engines of the vine,
   and how those effects change over the course of a growing season, are
   still largely unknown. Results: Here, we investigate associations
   between rootstock genotype and shoot system phenotypes using 5
   multi-dimensional leaf phenotyping modalities measured in a common
   grafted scion: ionomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, morphometrics,
   and physiology. Rootstock influence is ubiquitous but subtle across
   modalities, with the strongest signature of rootstock observed in the
   leaf ionome. Moreover, we find that the extent of rootstock influence on
   scion phenotypes and patterns of phenomic covariation are highly dynamic
   across the season. Conclusions: These findings substantially expand
   previously identified patterns to demonstrate that rootstock influence
   on scion phenotypes is complex and dynamic and underscore that broad
   understanding necessitates volumes of multi-dimensional data previously
   unmet.},

   (95.20\%), scion bud burst (65.43\%), graft union formation (82.22\%)
   also, longest shoots (1.84 cm) and maximum average leaf number (2.50).
   Regarding the effect of MS strength, 25\% MS, 50\% MS and 75\% MS
   achieved positive effects on all parameters compared with full MS. The
   anatomical study revealed that Red globe on Freedom combinations were
   the best due to enough callus formation, less necrotic layers, and a
   wavy continuity of new cambium were determined. Sterilized 1:1:1 (v:v)
   peatmoss+perlite+sand mix gave the highest survival rate (100.00\%) and
   showed superior vegetative growth. Freedom micrografts achieved the
   highest survival rate (100.00\%), better growth and longer roots
   compared with those on SO4 and Ramsey (80, 70\%) respectively.},

Abstract = {Viticulture is the cultivation and harvesting of grapes for use in the
   production of juices, wines and other derivatives, with great
   socioeconomic importance. Grafting techniques have been applied to
   increase productivity and quality in the sector, but the process of
   finding compatible cultivars is slow and costly. Although Machine
   Learning (ML) methods have already been applied in several applications
   in agriculture, their use to support grafting processes is still very
   scarce. This work investigates ML-based recommender systems to address
   the problem of scion and rootstock compatibility in grafting processes
   in viticulture. In the experiments, collaborative filtering algorithms
   and kernel-based methods were evaluated on a dataset of 251 rated
   interactions, reaching a F1-score of approximately 96\% for the best
   model. The results indicated advantages of kernel-based models over
   standard collaborative filtering models, as well as demonstrated the
   feasibility of a decision support tool to guide the choice of the best
   cultivars for grafting.},

Abstract = {The scientific literature of the last decades presents studies on the
   influence of global warming on vine, a sensitive plant, considered an
   indicator of climate change. Adaptation of grapevine to climate change
   is a major challenge for the vine-growing sector. More attention has
   been given lately to the methods of mitigating its effects, to
   maintaining the quality and to production sustainability. The latest
   research identifies many short-term measures (canopy management,
   application of sunscreen substances, soil management, pest and disease
   control, irrigation), medium-term (new training systems, minimal
   pruning, late pruning, shading nets) and long-term measures (relocation
   of vineyards, planting systems, land selection, scion/rootstock
   varieties, photovoltaic panels) to combat the negative effects of this
   phenomenon. This paper aims to present a synthesis of the studies
   conducted both in our country and worldwide, regarding measures to
   ensure the adaptation to new conditions.},

Journal = {VITIS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {147-152},
Abstract = {The establishment of a vineyard depends on clonal propagation of
   grapevine woody cuttings. The successful plant propagation relies on
   adventitious root formation, but it is affected by the scion-rootstock
   interaction. Synthetic auxins are used in the nursery to improve rooting
   of woody cuttings. We tested the effect of a quick dip (30 seconds) of
   increasing doses of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) solutions (0, 500, 750,
   1000, 1250, 1500 ppm) on rooting of grafted woody cuttings. We tested 5
   rootstocks (V. berlandieri x V. riparia), 110 Richter and 1103 Paulsen
   (V. berlandieri x V. rupestris), 101-14 Mgt (V. riparia x V. rupestris)
   and Cereza (V. vinifera L.). After 21 days in the callus chamber, we
   examined the quality of the root system by means of different rooting
   parameters (callusing and rooting percentage and number, length and
   biomass of roots per cutting). Among all the rooting parameters
   evaluated, Cereza presented the highest values in relation to the rest
   of the rootstocks, followed by 101-14 Mgt, SO4, 110R and 1103P. The
   quality of the root system was improved in terms of number of roots,
   length and the total biomass on four rootstocks: Cereza, 110R, 101-14
   Mgt and SO4, but not in 1103P whose rooting was unaffected by
   treatments. The optimal dose of IBA through quick-dip at improving
   rooting was rootstock-dependent, being 750 ppm for 110R, 101-14 Mgt and
   SO4; and 1000 ppm for Cereza. These results will contribute in reducing
   costs during clonal propabare-root vines.},

Title = {The functional microbiome of grapevine throughout plant evolutionary
   history and lifetime},
Booktitle = {FUNCTIONAL MICROBIOMES},
Series = {Advances in Ecological Research},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Pages = {27-99},
Abstract = {European grapevine is a complex holobiont composed of two plant genomes,
   that of the scion (Vitis vinifera L.) and the rootstock (Vitis spp.),
   and a multitude of microbial genomes that collectively form the
   microbiome. The grapevine microbiome has been extensively described over
   the last decade, primarily using metabarcoding approaches.
   Unfortunately, metabarcoding data alone provide little information on
   microbial functions and outcomes of plant-microbe interactions. Here we
   review knowledge about the microorganisms that have a demonstrated
   influence, positive or negative, on the performance of the grapevine
   holobiont. Our review encompasses bacteria, filamentous fungi, yeasts,
   oomycetes and viruses. It covers aboveground and belowground
   micro-organisms, including arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal
   fungi. We focus on taxa and functions that protect the plant against
   pathogens and pests, promote growth, increase tolerance to abiotic
   stresses and highlight those involved in disease and decline. As the
   outcomes of plant-microbe interactions are labile, we examine the
   dynamics and functions of grapevine-microbiome interactions over both
   the plant lifetime and the plant evolutionary history, beginning with
   plant domestication. Based on the knowledge and gaps we identify, we
   suggest field sampling designs, culture-based experiments, molecular
   tools and theoretical analysis methods, including shotgun metagenomics
   and network models, that could be used in future research to uncover and
   leverage the full functional potential of the grapevine microbiome.},

Title = {Evaluation of criteria to assist the selection of good quality grafted
   grapevines prior to their commercialisation},
Journal = {OENO ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},
Pages = {15-27},
Abstract = {The production of grafted grapevine plant material is a complex process
   with many steps running over at least one year, from grafting to final
   sorting in nurseries. To reach the market in France, grafted grapevines
   must meet three criteria by law: resistance to a manual graft union test
   (or thumb test), a minimum number of three roots and a woody, lignified
   stem which has grown from the bud of the scion wood of at least 2 cm
   long. This study aimed to evaluate the possibility of using visual
   criteria to select good quality grafted grapevines, without the need to
   do the thumb test because the thumb test is manual and therefore very
   subjective; the test depends on the strength applied by the person who
   realises it. This study was done on 22 scion/rootstock combinations with
   different degrees of grafting success, i.e., producing different
   proportions of marketable plants after one year in the nursery. The
   three legal criteria currently used to select marketable grafted
   grapevines in France as well as other external and measurable criteria
   such as the length of lignified stem and diameter, the number of thin
   and thick roots, and rootstock wood diameter were measured on the 22
   scion/rootstock combinations. Variation in the values for these
   different criteria was observed and correlations between the criteria
   and the number of marketable plants were studied. This data was then
   analysed to determine which visible criteria contribute most to
   identifying marketable grafts. The percentage of marketable grafts was
   most strongly correlated with the thumb test and positively correlated
   with the length of the lignified stem. The variables with the highest
   predictive effect for identifying marketable plants (other than the
   thumb test) were the number of large roots and the length of the
   lignified stem. The possibility of using visible criteria to screen for
   good quality grafted plants is discussed, but no single, or combination
   of criteria, was sufficiently strongly correlated with the percentage of
   marketable plants to replace the thumb test.},

Title = {Mitigating grapevine winter damage in cold climate areas},
Journal = {HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {59-70},
Abstract = {Growing grapes in cool climate areas is incredibly challenging due to
   the high risk of winter injury. Passive and active methods can be used
   to reduce or prevent cold damage and protect the vineyards. Passive
   protection methods are generally cultural practices and performed before
   cold damage events, such as cultivar and rootstock selection. The proper
   scion-rootstock combination would ideally help the vines acclimate
   earlier in the fall, allowing them to withstand colder weather in the
   fall and winter and de-acclimate later in the spring to minimise the
   late spring frost damage. The introduction of new North American hybrid
   cultivars accompanied with other cultural practices has increased the
   hope for developing viticulture in areas with lower cold hardiness
   zones. Furthermore, active protection methods are usually performed at
   the time of cold damage events to protect the vineyard by preventing or
   reducing the loss of thermal energy from vine tissues. The objective of
   this manuscript is to review the viticulture challenges in cold climates
   and mitigate the risks with Ontario, Canada as an example of a cold
   climate area.},

Title = {Water soaking and benzyladenine as strategy for improving grapevine
   grafting success},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE FRUTICULTURA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The grafting of grapevines has become essential to overcome biotic and
   abiotic stresses because permits access to the benefits of the
   agronomical characteristics of different rootstocks. Stimulating the
   rapid formation of the grafting union is the key to grafting success.
   This investigation studied the effect of removing growth inhibitors
   through soaking in water for 24 hours versus adding growth stimulate
   through fast dipping in 250 mg/L benzyladenine (BA) for 30 seconds of
   graft wood before grafting on the grafting success of `Flame Seedless'
   and `Early Sweet' scions (Vitis vinifera) grafted onto `Freedom'
   rootstock (Vitis champinii x 1613C). Water soaking came first and
   followed by treatment of 250 mg/L BA, which significantly improved the
   grafting success of both cultivars. Grafting success was positively
   associated with increasing callus formation at the grafting zone, which
   was accompanied with the highest total indols content, the lowest total
   phenols content, and peroxidase activity above and below the grafting
   zone. However, water soaking significantly increased total indols and
   decreased the total phenols content of the ungrafted cuttings. In this
   study, it was suggested that the application of water soaking to grafted
   cuttings prior to grafting is an environmentally friendly and
   alternative practice for synthetic growth regulators to improve grafted
   cuttings success.},

Title = {Effects of grape phylloxera leaf infestation on grapevine growth and
   yield parameters in commercial vineyards: a pilot study},
Journal = {OENO ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {197-208},
Abstract = {Grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) can infest both roots and
   leaves of Vitis species. In commercial vineyards planted with Vitis
   vinifera scions grafted on rootstocks, grape phylloxera infestation is
   generally limited to root feeding. Vineyards are, however, increasingly
   subjected to vineyard-wide foliar infestations that last throughout the
   growing season. While some vineyards are affected by the infestation
   pressure of external leaf-feeding populations, other annually affected
   V. vinifera vineyards do not have these in their vicinity. Much is known
   about the damage potential of grape phylloxera root feeding; however,
   data on how phylloxera leaf infestation affects V. vinifera grapevines
   in commercial vineyards are lacking. This study, therefore, aimed to
   assess whether grapevine growth and yield are affected due to leaf
   infestation as it occurred in three commercial vineyards in the study
   area. Treatments were based on phylloxera leaf infestation and
   additional defoliation. Single-leaf carbon acquisition was measured with
   gas exchange analyses on healthy and galled leaves. Pruning weight and
   internode length were measured to assess the effect of leaf infestation
   and the effect of plant growth and vigour on leaf gall outbreaks. Yield
   quantity and quality were measured, and grapes were vinified for sensory
   analyses. Furthermore, using enzymatic analyses, non-structural
   carbohydrates were analysed in perennial wood. A significant decrease in
   sugar content in grapes (10 \%) and starch reserves in perennial wood
   (11 \%) was found in the most heavily infested vineyard. Grape must of
   infested plants in another vineyard furthermore showed a significantly
   higher level of titratable acid (7.5 \%). Significant infestation
   effects seen in one vineyard were not significant in the other two
   vineyards. No significant differences were seen for carbon acquisition,
   harvest quantity, wine sensory analysis, pruning weight or internode
   length. The overall effect of phylloxera leaf infestation in the studied
   vineyards was, therefore, marginal. Grapevine vigour did not differ
   between infested vines, insecticide-sprayed vines, and vines on which no
   leaf infestation outbreaks took place. By analysing phylloxera leaf
   infestation under field conditions, these preliminary results form a
   basis for future long-term field studies about phylloxera leaf feeding
   on Vitis vinifera within the context of other biotic and abiotic plant
   stresses.},

Title = {Physiological and chemical performance of the Flame seedless grapevine
   cultivar in the presence of Paulsen 1103 as the interstock},
Journal = {CIENCIA E AGROTECNOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Abstract = {Interstock is commonly used in deciduous fruit trees as a sustainable
   strategy to reduce the vigor of the scion associated with the high
   quality of fruits. In this study, we tested the effect of Paulsen 1103
   (Vitis beriandieri x Vitis rupestris) as interstock on the grafting
   success, growth, and the physiological and chemical parameters of Flame
   seedless (Vitis vinifera) grapevine grafted onto Freedom (Vitis
   champinii x 1613C) and Paulsen 1103 rootstocks. This study was conducted
   over two seasons (2019 and 2020). The results indicated that direct
   grafting on the Paulsen 1103 rootstock recorded the highest grafting
   success percentage. Moreover, the grafting success percentage increased
   significantly when Paulsen 1103 was used as interstock between Flame
   seedless and Freedom rootstock (FI/P/Fr) compared to the grafting
   success without Paulsen 1103 interstock (FI/Fr). Also, using Paulsen
   1103 as interstock between Flame seedless scion and Freedom rootstock
   (FI/P/Fr) significantly reduced the morphological parameters (shoot
   length, leaf area and the dry weight of shoots and roots) and
   physiological parameters of leaf (relative water content, transpiration
   rate, and stomatal conductance) but significantly increased the leaf
   chemical content (peroxidase activity, total phenols, total proline, and
   total soluble sugar content) compared to values of the parameters
   measured in Flame seedless grafted onto Freedom rootstock (Fl/Fr).
   Peroxidase activity could be used for predicting the degree of
   compatibility in grapevine grafts. This study suggested that the effect
   of Paulsen 1103 interstock on the vegetative growth of scion is
   correlated with its effect on chemical content and physiological
   responses of the scion.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the productive performance and
   physicochemical traits of wine grape cultivars (Cabernet Sauvignon,
   Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Sauvignon Blanc) grafted on two
   different rootstocks (IAC 766 Campinas, and 106-8 Mgt) under subtropical

   of variance and principal component analysis showed that Cabernet Franc

   addition to that, Cabernet Sauvignon presented the lowest production and
   the smallest grape berries of all. With regards to rootstocks, IAC 766
   induced higher scions yield than 106-8 Mgt; besides that, IAC 766 had
   greater affinity with Cabernet Franc and Merlot, which was observed by
   the increase in the number of bunches per vine, larger and heavier
   bunches, as well as higher soluble solids content and pH value than the
   ones in 106-8 Mgt. Furthermore, IAC 766 also induced higher soluble

Title = {Grapevine rootstock genotypes influences berry and wine phenolic
   composition (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinot noir)},
Journal = {OENO ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {133-144},
Abstract = {Grapevine rootstocks can affect the nitrogen (N) status of the grafted
   plant due to discrepancies in their nutrient uptake and their efficiency
   in the allocation of assimilates. When N becomes a limiting factor, the
   production of phenolic compounds in grapes is enhanced as a result of a
   down-regulation of the flavonoid production pathway. However, it is
   still not fully understood if the impact of rootstocks on fruit and wine
   composition is mediated by their effect on the vegetative growth and N
   status of the scion. The main objective of the study was to test if
   rootstock influence on Pinot noir berry and wine phenolic composition
   could be related to the N status of the scion. An investigation was
   carried out on Pinot noir (Vitis vinifera L.) vines grafted onto six
   rootstocks over three vintages (2012-2014). A micro-scale fermentation
   technique was used to produce wines from each field replicate. Scions
   grafted onto SO4, a high vigour rootstock, were characterised by a 15 \%
   higher tannin concentration in berry seed and skin compared to those
   grafted onto the low vigour Riparia Gloire de Montpellier, while final
   tannin concentration in wines depended on the rootstock. Anthocyanin
   concentration was higher in berries of Pinot noir grafted onto R110
   compared to 125AA, which was also reflected in the wines. A Multiple
   Linear Regression analysis suggested that rootstock influence on berry
   anthocyanins was linked to the N status of scion leaves (higher Leaf
   NBI\_R). Understanding the interaction between the N uptake efficiency
   of rootstocks and scion berry/wine phenolic composition will help
   improve the selection of suitable rootstocks that match the desired wine
   profile.},

   the yield performance and physical and physical-chemical traits of `BRS
   Magna' juice grapes grown in the Submedio do Vale do Sao Francisco. The
   study was performed over six production cycles in the period from 2015
   to 2019 in the Bebedouro experimental field of Embrapa Semiarido in
   Petrolina, PE, Brazil. The treatments consisted of seven grapevine
   rootstocks: IAC 572, IAC 766, IAC 313, Paulsen 1103, SO4, Harmony, and
   Freedom. The following variables were evaluated: estimated yield, number
   of grape bunches per plant, branch and leaf fresh matter, bunch weight,
   bunch length and width, berry weight, total soluble solids content (SS),
   titratable acidity (TA), and SS to TA ratio (SS:TA). Significant effects
   of the rootstock were observed in all the variables except for SS. The
   rootstock `IAC 572' led to increases of up to 61\% in the yield of `BRS
   Magna' grapevines, or 32.78 ton.ha(-1), with significant responses in
   the other yield components. Results of the scatterplot in relation to
   the first three principal components allowed separation of the
   rootstocks in accordance with production cycles. The mean values for SS
   and TA characterize this cultivar in the Vale do Submedio Sao Francisco,
   with high soluble solids content and low acidity resulting in high
   SS:TA, as having potential for preparation of high quality juices,
   regardless of the rootstock used.},

Abstract = {Soil microbiota has increasingly been shown to play an integral role in
   viticulture resilience. The emergence of new metagenomic and culturomic
   technologies has led to significant advances in the study of microbial
   biodiversity. In the agricultural sector, soil and plant microbiomes
   have been found to significantly improve resistance to environmental
   stressors and diseases, as well as influencing crop yields and fruit
   quality thus improving sustainability under shifting environments.
   Grapevines are usually cultivated as a scion grafted on rootstocks,
   which are selected according to pedoclimatic conditions and cultural
   practices, known as terroir. The rootstock connects the surrounding soil
   to the vine's aerial part and impacts scion growth and berry quality.
   Understanding rootstock and soil microbiome dynamics is a relevant and
   important field of study, which may be critical to improve viticulture
   sustainability and resilience. This review aims to highlight the
   relationship between grapevine roots and telluric microbiota diversity
   and activity. In addition, this review explores the concept of core
   microbiome regarding potential applications of soil microbiome
   engineering with the goal of enhancing grapevine adaptation to biotic
   and abiotic stress.},

Title = {Grafting with rootstocks promotes phenolic compound accumulation in
   grape berry skin during development based on integrative multi-omics
   analysis},
Journal = {HORTICULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {In viticulture, grafting has been practiced widely and influences grape
   development as well as berry and wine quality. However, there is limited
   understanding of the effects of rootstocks on grape phenolic compounds,
   which are located primarily in the berry skin and contribute to certain
   sensory attributes of wine. In this study, scion-rootstock interactions
   were investigated at the green-berry stage and the veraison stage when
   grapevines were hetero-grafted with three commonly used rootstock
   genotypes (5BB, 101-14MG, and SO4). Physiological investigations showed
   that hetero-grafts, especially CS/5BB, contained higher concentrations
   of total proanthocyanidins (PAs) and various PA components in berry
   skins compared with the auto-grafted grapevines. Further metabolomics
   analysis identified 105 differentially accumulated flavonoid compounds,
   the majority of which, including anthocyanins, PAs, and flavonols, were
   significantly increased in the berry skins of hetero-grafted grapevines
   compared with auto-grafted controls. In addition, transcriptomic
   analysis of the same samples identified several thousand differentially
   expressed genes between hetero-grafted and auto-grafted vines. The three
   rootstocks not only increased the transcript levels of stilbene,
   anthocyanin, PA, and flavonol synthesis genes but also affected the
   expression of numerous transcription factor genes. Taken together, our
   results suggest that hetero-grafting can promote phenolic compound
   accumulation in grape berry skin during development. These findings
   provide new insights for improving the application value of grafting by
   enhancing the accumulation of nutritious phenolic components in grape.},

Title = {Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal the effects of self- and
   hetero-grafting on anthocyanin biosynthesis in grapevine},
Journal = {HORTICULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Grafting, which joins a scion from a cultivar with the stem of a
   rootstock from a grapevine wild relative, is commonly used in
   viticulture. Grafting has crucial effects on various phenotypes of the
   cultivar, including its phenology, biotic and abiotic resistance, berry
   metabolome, and coloration, but the underlying genetics and regulatory
   mechanisms are largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the
   phenotypic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiles at three
   developmental stages (45, 75, and 105 days after flowering) of the
   Crimson Seedless cultivar (Vitis vinifera) grafted onto four rootstocks
   (three heterografts, CS/101-14, CS/SO4, and CS/110R and one self-graft,
   CS/CS) with own-rooted graft-free Crimson Seedless (CS) as the control.
   All the heterografts had a significant effect on berry reddening as
   early as similar to 45 days after flowering. The grafting of rootstocks
   promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation in grape berries. The
   metabolomic features showed that cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin
   3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and
   petunidin 3-O-glucoside were the pigments responsible for the
   purplish-red peel color. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that
   anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes, from upstream (phenylalanine
   ammonia-lyase) to downstream (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase and
   anthocyanidin synthase), were upregulated with the accumulation of
   anthocyanins in the heterografted plants. At the same time, all these
   genes were also highly expressed and more anthocyanin was accumulated in
   self-grafted CS/CS samples compared with own-rooted graft-free CS
   samples, suggesting that self-grafting may also have promoted berry
   reddening in grapevine. Our results reveal global transcriptomic and
   metabolomic features in berry color regulation under different grafting
   conditions that may be useful for improving berry quality in
   viticulture.},

Title = {Identifying early metabolite markers of successful graft union formation
   in grapevine},
Journal = {HORTICULTURE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Grafting is an important horticultural technique used for many crop
   species. However, some scion/rootstock combinations are considered as
   incompatible due to poor graft union formation and subsequently high
   plant mortality. The early identification of graft incompatibility could
   allow the selection of non-viable plants before planting and would have
   a beneficial impact on research and development in the nursery sector.
   In general, visible phenotypes of grafted plants (size, root number,
   etc.) are poorly correlated with grafting success, but some studies have
   suggested that some polyphenols could be used as markers of graft
   incompatibility several months or years after grafting. However, much of
   the previous studies into metabolite markers of grafting success have
   not included all the controls necessary to unequivocally validate the
   markers proposed. In this study, we quantified 73 primary and secondary
   metabolites in nine hetero-grafts and six homo-grafted controls 33 days
   after grafting at the graft interface and in both the scion and
   rootstock woody tissues. Certain biomarker metabolites typical of a high
   stress status (such as proline, GABA and pallidol) were particularly
   accumulated at the graft interface of the incompatible scion/rootstock
   combination. We then used correlation analysis and generalized linear
   models to identify potential metabolite markers of grafting success
   measured one year after grafting. Here we present the first attempt to
   quantitatively predict graft compatibility and identify marker
   metabolites (especially asparagine, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceatannol
   and alpha-viniferin) 33 days after grafting, which was found to be
   particularly informative for homo-graft combinations.},

Abstract = {Grafting is an ancient method that has been intensively used for the
   clonal propagation of vegetables and woody trees. Despite its importance
   in agriculture the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying

   grafting per se dramatically influences the small RNA populations
   independently of genotypes but also show genotype specific effects. In
   addition, we demonstrate that bilateral exchanges of small RNAs, mainly
   short interfering RNAs, may occur in heterograft with the preferential
   transfer of small RNAs from the scion to the rootstock. Altogether, the
   results suggest that small RNAs may have an important role in the
   phenotype modifications observed in heterografts.},

   Camellia oleifera Seedlings},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Grafting provides a way to improve tolerance to low phosphorus (P)
   stress for plants, and has been extensively applied in commercial
   cultivars grafted onto appropriate rootstocks. However, little
   literature is available concerning the scion-mediated effect on P
   efficiency in grafted plants. In this study, three different Camellia
   oleifera Abel. scion cultivars (G8, G83-1, and W2) were grafted onto the
   same rootstock (W2) under controls (0.5 mM) and low-P (0 mM)
   availability for eight months. The results showed that the scions
   significantly affected root-to-shoot weight ratios, the root morphology
   with a diameter larger than 1 mm, P accumulation, and the P utilization
   efficiency (PUE) of the root. A higher increase in the root-to-shoot
   weight ratio under the low-P supply was observed in the G83-1/W2
   (26.15\%) than in the G8/W2 (0\%) and the W2/W2 (5.32\%). Root PUE of
   the scion G8, G83-1, and W2 was improved by up to 113.73\%, 45.46\%, and
   20.97\% under the low-P supply. Moreover, G8/W2 exhibited higher shoot P
   accumulation and the highest root PUE under the low-P supply, indicating
   a high capability to tolerate P deficiency by maximizing the
   cost-effectiveness of P remobilization to photosynthetic organs. This
   suggested the vigorous variety of G8 could be a promising scion to
   improve grafted C. oleifera tolerance to low-P stress. Our results would
   have important implications for exploration and identification of a
   superior scion variety to enhance the ability of resistance concerning P
   deficiency stress in C. oleifera.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Protein expression from the berry skin of four red grape biotypes with
   varying hybrid character was compared at a proteome-wide level to
   identify the metabolic pathways underlying divergent patterns of
   secondary metabolites. A bottom-up shotgun proteomics approach with
   label-free quantification and MaxQuant-assisted computational analysis
   was applied. Red grapes were from (i) purebred Vitis vinifera (Aglianico
   cv.); (ii) V. vinifera (local Sciascinoso cv.) grafted onto an American
   rootstock; (iii) interspecific hybrid (V. vinifera x V. labrusca,
   Isabel), and (iv) uncharacterized grape genotype with hybrid lineage,
   producing relatively abundant anthocyanidin 3,5-O-diglucosides.
   Proteomics supported the differences between hybrids and purebred V.
   vinifera grapes, consistently with distinct phenotypic metabolite
   assets. Methanol O-anthraniloyltransferase, which catalyses the
   synthesis of methyl anthranilate, primarily responsible for the
   ``foxy{''} odour, was exclusive of the Isabel hybrid grape. Most of the
   proteins with different expression profiles converged into coordinated
   biosynthetic networks of primary metabolism, while many possible enzymes
   of secondary metabolism pathways, including 5-glucosyltransferases
   expected for hybrid grapes, remained unassigned due to incomplete
   protein annotation for the Vitis genus. Minor differences of protein
   expression distinguished V. vinifera scion grafted onto American
   rootstocks from purebred V. vinifera skin grapes, supporting a slight
   influence of the rootstock on the grape metabolism.},

   perspective},
Journal = {SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {299},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Grafting is a method for plant propagation and improvement. In the
   European viticulture, grafting is the sole control strategy against
   Phylloxera injuries and thus is of crucial importance for sustainable
   grape production. Despite its benefits, grafting is also a source for
   disease dissemination and graft incompatibility sometimes detected long
   after grafting can result in propagation losses. However, the physiology
   of grafting, such as compatibility factors, callus formation and healing
   processes, and the signaling components exchanged between scion and
   rootstock, are still not well understood by the scientific community.
   Recent insights in grafting research hint at a complex scion-rootstock
   communication. Molecules exchanged between rootstock and scion, such as
   hormones, metabolites, proteins, and RNAs coordinate the grafted plant
   parts and are suspected to modulate the healing of the union and to
   facilitate the regeneration of the vascular tissues. Such processes
   result in a successful grafted plant but in many cases, the graft
   develops distress symptoms, which can appear in early or late stages of
   plant growth eventually leading to a so-called `graft incompatibility'.
   It is not known whether the cause of incompatibility is based on a
   rejection of the opposing partners, on growth differences, or on the
   stress induced by grafting itself. One potential factor leading to graft
   incompatibility can be based on a deficiency of the recognition of
   graft-transmissible RNA signals shown to coordinate developmental and
   environmental shoot-root responses. This review summarizes the current
   knowledge on grafting from the perspective of viticulture, discusses the
   hypotheses behind graft incompatibility, addresses the molecular effects
   of grafting, and novel research perspectives that might help to unveil
   this millenary mystery.},

Abstract = {This review highlights the contributions of CSIRO to the development of
   new scions and rootstocks for the Australian winegrape, driedgrape and
   tablegrape industries. Initially, CSIRO played a pivotal role in the
   selection of high-yielding Sultana clones which contributed over half
   the total Australian grape crop in the 1970s used for wine- and
   driedgrape production. It was also responsible for importation and
   evaluation of the Salt Creek (syn. Ramsey) rootstock which provided
   tolerance to root-knot nematodes and salinity and became the most widely
   adopted rootstock for the emerging Australian wine industry in the
   1980-1990s. The CSIRO has also successfully bred or released several new
   grape cultivars. While the adoption rate for the CSIRO wine cultivars
   has been limited, CSIRO-selected cultivars dominate the Australian
   driedgrape industry, while CSIRO-released cultivars continue to play an
   important role in the Australian tablegrape industry. In the 1990s,
   CSIRO commenced the application of molecular biology techniques for
   grapevine germplasm improvement. Researchers from CSIRO were some of the
   first in the world to successfully regenerate transgenic grapevines and
   demonstrate the potential of this technology to produce low-browning
   driedgrapes and mildew-resistant premium winegrapes. More recently, the
   focus has shifted to the mapping of resistance loci from wild grape
   species and their introgression into new winegrape scions to provide
   resistance to mildews and new rootstocks to provide durable resistance
   to rootknot nematodes and phylloxera. Finally, this review considers
   some future challenges faced by the Australian grape industries and how
   these might be addressed using conventional or molecular breeding
   strategies.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background and Aims Rootstock type can lead to differences in scion
   canopy growth and fruit yield by conferring specific traits to the
   scion. Conferred traits may interact to alter the relationship between
   vine water use and fruit yield, providing a mechanism whereby rootstocks
   could be used to improve the water use efficiency of fruit production.
   This study aimed to determine whether rootstock conferred vigour and
   crop water use index (yield per unit water transpired) were linked.
   Methods and Results Seven rootstock genotypes, grafted with Shiraz, in a
   trial established over 20 years previously, were assessed over four
   seasons for vigour, yield and leaf physiology, and over three seasons
   for whole vine transpiration using sapflow sensors. There were
   consistent differences in rootstock conferred traits, with yield being
   affected to a lesser extent than vigour or vine water use. Conclusions
   The water use efficiency of fruit production was improved for Shiraz on
   low vigour conferring rootstocks, due to a combination of rootstock
   conferred effects on scion vigour, leaf gas exchange, whole vine
   transpiration and yield. Significance of the Study The study has
   demonstrated that rootstock conferred traits can alter the crop water
   use index of the scion in a mature vineyard. Consequently, accurately
   matching irrigation application with vigour and leaf physiology traits
   of the chosen rootstock has the potential to be used as a tool to

Abstract = {Previous research determined that Fusarium acuminatum and F. avenaceum
   are important causal agents of a canker disease in bareroot-propagated
   fruit and nut trees in California that emerges during cold storage or
   after transplanting. The disease largely disappeared after 2001, but it
   reemerged in 2011 in almond trees in at least one nursery. This
   motivated further study of the etiology and epidemiology of the disease
   by undertaking studies to determine distribution of the pathogens
   throughout almond nursery propagation systems and trace possible sources
   of inoculum. Research initiated in 2013 detected pathogenic Fusarium
   spp. throughout the almond propagation system, including in healthy
   trees, in soils, on wheat rotation crops, on equipment, and in the
   cold-storage facility air. In addition to the two Fusarium spp.
   implicated previously, F. brachygibbosum and a new Fusarium species, F.
   californicum, were found to be pathogenic on almond trees. Multilocus
   sequence typing and somatic compatibility testing confirmed that
   isolates within a species collected from different materials in the
   nursery were all highly genetically similar and likely of one clonal
   lineage. These findings affirm that equipment surfaces, wheat rotation
   crops, soil, cold-storage facility air, and asymptomatic almond tree
   materials (i.e., rootstock cuttings, budwood, and scions) can
   potentially contribute inoculum to increase disease prevalence and
   severity.},

Abstract = {Rootstocks are the link between the soil and scion in grapevines, can
   provide tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and regulate yield and
   grape quality. The vascular system of grapevine rootstocks in nurseries
   is still an underexplored niche for research, despite its potential for
   hosting beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate the changes in the composition of fungal
   communities in 110 Richter and 41 Berlandieri rootstocks at four stages
   of the grapevine propagation process. Taxonomic analysis revealed that
   the fungal community predominantly consisted of phylum Ascomycota in all
   stages of the propagation process. The alpha-diversity of fungal
   communities differed among sampling times for both rootstocks, with
   richness and fungal diversity in the vascular system decreasing through
   the propagation process. The core microbiome was composed of the genera
   Cadophora, Cladosporium, Penicillium and Alternaria in both rootstocks,
   while the pathogenic genus Neofusicoccum was identified as a persistent
   taxon throughout the propagation process. FUNguild analysis showed that
   the relative abundance of plant pathogens associated with trunk diseases
   increased towards the last stage in nurseries. Fungal communities in the
   vascular system of grapevine rootstocks differed between the different
   stages of the propagation process in nurseries. Numerous genera
   associated with potential biocontrol activity and grapevine trunk
   diseases were identified. Understanding the large diversity of fungi in
   the rootstock vascular tissue and the interactions between fungal
   microbiota and grapevine will help to develop sustainable strategies for
   grapevine protection.},

Abstract = {Background and Aims Grafting in viticulture has been essential since the
   advent of the phylloxera crisis at the end of the 19th century, but
   relatively little is known about the relevance of the quality of the
   connection at the grafting junction on the behaviour of grafted
   grapevines. Methods and Results An experimental procedure comparing
   omega grafted vines with complete alignment of the scion and the
   rootstock (CA) and vines with partial alignment (PA) was developed.
   Three complementary trials were carried out in the nursery, in the field
   and under controlled conditions. The CA vines increased the success rate
   in the nursery. Vine growth was significantly affected by the alignment
   between the rootstock and scion both in the nursery and in their first
   year of establishment in a commercial vineyard and in a potted trial,
   although these differences dissipated in years 2 and 3 under commercial
   vineyard conditions. The CA graft also maintained a higher level of leaf
   gas exchange, but such differences did not correspond to those in the
   hydraulic conductivity across the graft union itself. Conclusions The
   degree of alignment of the grafted vine material affected vine
   development, but a better understanding of the role of vascular
   connections in different graft types and qualities is needed.
   Significance of the Study To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first scientific study that developed an experimental procedure for
   assessing the implication of the alignment at the grafting point on
   grapevine physiology and water use.},

Abstract = {To alleviate biotic and abiotic stresses and enhance fruit yield, many
   crops are cultivated in the form of grafted plants, in which the shoot
   (scion) and root (rootstock) systems of different species are joined
   together. Because (i) the plant species determines the microbial
   recruitment from the soil to the root and (ii) both scion and rootstock
   impact the physiology, morphology and biochemistry of the grafted plant,
   it can be expected that their different combinations should affect the
   recruitment and assembly of plant microbiome. To test our hypothesis, we
   investigated at a field scale the bacterial and fungal communities
   associated with the root system of seven grapevine rootstock-scion
   combinations cultivated across 10 different vineyards. Following the
   soil type, which resulted in the main determinant of the grapevine root
   microbial community diversity, the rootstock-scion combination resulted
   more important than the two components taken alone. Notably, the
   microbiome differences among the rootstock-scion combinations were
   mainly dictated by the changes in the relative abundance of microbiome
   members rather than by their presence/absence. These results reveal that
   the microbiome of grafted grapevine root systems is largely influenced
   by the combination of rootstock and scion, which affects the microbial
   diversity uptaken from soil.},

   Anion Concentration in Transgenic Arabidopsis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Grapevines (Vitis vinifera L., Vvi) on their roots are generally
   sensitive to salt-forming ions, particularly chloride (Cl-) when grown
   in saline environments. Grafting V. vinifera scions to Cl--excluding
   hybrid rootstocks reduces the impact of salinity. Molecular components
   underlying Cl--exclusion in Vitis species remain largely unknown,
   however, various anion channels and transporters represent good
   candidates for controlling this trait. Here, two nitrate/peptide
   transporter family (NPF) members VviNPF2.1 and VviNPF2.2 were isolated.
   Both highly homologous proteins localized to the plasma membrane of
   Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protoplasts. Both were expressed
   primarily in grapevine roots and leaves and were more abundant in a
   Cl--excluding rootstock compared to a Cl--includer. Quantitative PCR of
   grapevine roots revealed that VviNPF2.1 and 2.2 expression was
   downregulated by high {[}NO3-] resupply post-starvation, but not
   affected by 25 mM Cl-. VviNPF2.2 was functionally characterized using an
   Arabidopsis enhancer trap line as a heterologous host which enabled
   cell-type-specific expression. Constitutive expression of VviNPF2.2
   exclusively in the root epidermis and cortex reduced shoot {[}Cl-] after
   a 75 mM NaCl treatment. Higher expression levels of VviNPF2.2 correlated
   with reduced Arabidopsis xylem sap {[}NO3-] when not salt stressed. We
   propose that when expressed in the root epidermis and cortex, VviNPF2.2
   could function in passive anion efflux from root cells, which reduces
   the symplasmic Cl- available for root-to-shoot translocation. VviNPF2.2,
   through its role in the root epidermis and cortex, could, therefore, be
   beneficial to plants under salt stress by reducing net shoot Cl-
   accumulation.},

Abstract = {Background and Aims Water deficit modifies the concentration of the
   aroma compounds of grape berries, but little information is available on
   the effect of deficits applied at different phenological stages. We
   evaluated the effect of deficit irrigation on glycosylated volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) responsible for the aroma of berries of
   Sangiovese and Merlot cultivars grafted on 1103P or SO4 rootstocks.
   Methods and Results Vines were subjected to either pre- or post-veraison
   water stress, and berry composition compared against that of fruit of
   fully irrigated vines. At harvest, a higher concentration of
   glycosylated VOCs was measured in berries from vines stressed
   pre-veraison, but while it increased as water deficit increased in
   Sangiovese, this occurred only at a low or moderate level of stress in
   Merlot. Post-veraison water stress had a negative or negligible effect
   on the concentration of glycosylated VOCs in berries at harvest. The
   rootstock affected the concentration of glycosylated VOCs, particularly
   in vines stressed pre-veraison, with higher glycosylated VOCs observed
   for SO4 grafted vines than for 1103P grafted vines. Conclusions
   Pre-veraison water deficit enhanced the concentration of berry
   glycosylated VOCs, while post-veraison deficit did not. The
   rootstock-scion interaction might amplify the irrigation effect on berry
   glycosylated VOCs. Significance of the Study Modifying the timing and
   volume of irrigation might allow management of berry flavour for
   improved fruit and wine composition. Irrigation protocols should be

   Young `Tempranillo' Vines Grafted Onto Different Rootstocks},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {The use of more salt stress-tolerant vine rootstocks can be a
   sustainable strategy for adapting traditional grapevine cultivars to
   future conditions. However, how the new M1 and M4 rootstocks perform
   against salinity compared to conventional ones, such as the
   1103-Paulsen, had not been previously assessed under real field
   conditions. Therefore, a field trial was carried out in a young
   `Tempranillo' (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard grafted onto all three
   rootstocks under a semi-arid and hot-summer Mediterranean climate. The
   vines were irrigated with two kinds of water: a non-saline Control with
   EC of 0.8 dS m(-1) and a Saline treatment with 3.5 dS m(-1). Then,
   various physiological parameters were assessed in the scion, and,
   additionally, gene expression was studied by high throughput sequencing
   in leaf and berry tissues. Plant water relations evidenced the osmotic
   effect of water quality, but not that of the rootstock. Accordingly,
   leaf-level gas exchange rates were also reduced in all three rootstocks,
   with M1 inducing significantly lower net photosynthesis rates than
   1103-Paulsen. Nevertheless, the expression of groups of genes involved
   in photosynthesis and amino acid metabolism pathways were not
   significantly and differentially expressed. The irrigation with saline
   water significantly increased leaf chloride contents in the scion onto
   the M-rootstocks, but not onto the 1103P. The limitation for leaf Cl-
   and Na+ accumulation on the scion was conferred by rootstock. Few
   processes were differentially regulated in the scion in response to the
   saline treatment, mainly, in the groups of genes involved in the
   flavonoids and phenylpropanoids metabolic pathways. However, these
   transcriptomic effects were not fully reflected in grape phenolic
   ripeness, with M4 being the only one that did not cause reductions in
   these compounds in response to salinity, and 1103-Paulsen having the
   highest overall concentrations. These results suggest that all three
   rootstocks confer short-term salinity tolerance to the scion. The lower
   transcriptomic changes and the lower accumulation of potentially
   phytotoxic ions in the scion grafted onto 1103-Paulsen compared to
   M-rootstocks point to the former being able to maintain this
   physiological response in the longer term. Further agronomic trials
   should be conducted to confirm these effects on vine physiology and
   transcriptomics in mature vineyards.},

Abstract = {Vitis x champini cv. Dogridge is the only commercially popular rootstock
   held by the Indian grape industry, owing to its several advantages with
   respect to moisture stress tolerance, exclusion of chloride and
   improving scion vigour. However, over-dependence on a single rootstock
   might pose a serious threat to the grape industry; thus, broadening the
   genetic base of Dogridge is inevitable to address introgression of
   candidate genes that can adapt to diverse adverse situations, especially
   with respect to tolerance to sodicity, which is lacking in Dogridge.
   Flowering in Dogridge is challenging and induction of the reproductive
   phase from the vegetative phase in Dogridge needs to be attempted.
   Pruning was found to be successful, and this study focussed on pruning
   timings and severity. The investigation was conducted at ICAR-Indian
   Institute of Horticultural Research, Bengaluru. Pruning timings from
   September Iota fortnight to January Iota Iota fortnight along with
   pruning severity of five to eight bud levels were conducted.
   Observations related to flower set percentage and fruit set percentage
   were recorded, and key growth stages were depicted. These parameters
   were associated with maximum and minimum temperature. Pruning timings of
   January Iota and December Iota Iota fortnight produced the highest
   flowering, followed by October Iota and September Iota Iota fortnight
   pruning, while the highest percentage of fruit set was accounted for in
   October Iota and September Iota Iota fortnight pruning. Similarly, per
   cent flowering and per cent fruit set was also affected by pruning
   severity and was highest in 5th and 6th bud level pruning. Lower minimum
   temperature of 11-13 degrees C and higher diurnal temperature variation
   favoured the highest per cent flowering in December Iota Iota and
   January Iota fortnight pruning, while higher maximum temperature during
   fruit development hampered fruitfulness. However, the temperature
   prevailed during the reproductive stage of Dogridge when pruned in
   September Iota Iota and October Iota fortnight resulted in higher
   numbers of flowers and fruit set. This information may boost rootstock
   breeding in Dogridge to improve its drought and salinity.},

Abstract = {Wild progenitors of grapevine constitute a diverse source of genetic
   variability which have been used as a potential rootstock to cope with
   different abiotic and biotic stresses. In Pakistan, wild grapevine
   accessions locally called Dakh, Fatati, Toran, Zarishk, and Kishmish
   naturally exist in mountainous and sub-mountainous regions of humid and
   sub-humid areas. However, many vineyards that are cultivated as own
   rooted crops have been affected by many environmental or edaphic
   conditions. To cope with these adverse conditions, it is the utmost need
   to cultivate highly productive Vitis varieties with suitable rootstocks,
   but compatibility is a major concern between these grafted plants. In
   the present study, in vitro cleft grafting was used to evaluate the
   compatibility of these wild grapevine accessions as rootstocks with
   other commercial scion varieties like King's Ruby and Flame Seedless.
   Wild grapevine accessions Dakh, Kishmish, and Toran showed a relatively
   improved rate of compatibility with commercial scion varieties compared
   to Zarishk and Fatati accessions. Initially, a slower but stable process
   of graft compatibility between wild grapevine accessions and scion
   varieties was observed at 10 days after grafting. Differentiation of
   parenchymatous cells into vascular bundles started at 15 days after
   grafting, whereas complete formation of vascular bundles at graft
   junctions of wild grapevine accessions and commercial scion varieties
   was observed at 21 days after grafting. This initiation of vascular
   layers at the initial stage helped the improvement of shoot growth of
   scion varieties grafted on wild grapevine accessions Dakh and Kishmish.
   Moreover, a higher rate of root growth was observed in grafted wild
   grapevine accessions Dakh, Zarishk, and Kishmish compared to Fatati and
   Toran. Among both commercial scion varieties, King's Ruby resulted
   (54-59\%) as more effective when grafted with wild grapevine accessions.},

   almond leaf scorch disease. Previous research showed that prior to
   June-budding, this rootstock can prevent infection of almond nursery
   stock by X. fastidiosa. Further, the rootstock also promotes recovery
   from infection in susceptible almond scions. Objectives of this study
   were to 1) compare movement and bacterial populations of X. fastidiosa
   in almond and Nemaguard, 2) determine whether the metabolic profile of
   infected versus noninfected plants of each species correspond with
   differences in pathogen distribution, and 3) evaluate the impact of
   feeding on Nemaguard on transmission efficiency and pathogen populations
   in insects. Results showed limited or no movement of X. fastidiosa
   beyond the point of mechanical inoculation in Nemaguard, whereas X.
   fastidiosa was detected in susceptible almond and isolated from plant
   samples distal to the point of inoculation. Large differences in the
   concentration of phenolic compounds between Nemaguard and almond were
   also found, although this was not impacted by infection status. After
   acquiring X. fastidiosa from infected plants, vector access periods of
   up to 14 days on Nemaguard neither reduced pathogen populations in
   vectors nor reduced transmission efficiency of X. fastidiosa to
   susceptible plants when compared with similar vector-access periods on
   susceptible grapevines. Results suggest Nemaguard, in spite of having
   high phenolic concentrations in its xylem, does not directly impact X.
   fastidiosa survival and that future research should focus on
   identification of potential physical traits that prevent bacterial
   attachment, multiplication, or movement within the plant.},

Abstract = {Rootstocks were bred and selected from several species in order to
   enhance the resistance against biotic or abiotic stresses. There are few
   studies on the effect of rootstocks on aroma and related gene
   expression. This study focused on the effects of three rootstocks, Kober
   5BB (5BB), 1103 Paulsen (1103P), and Selection Oppenheim (SO4), on the
   aroma and volatile-related gene expression levels of Merlot and Marselan
   berries and wines. These three rootstocks reduced the total aroma
   content of Merlot wine. 5BB upregulated VvLoXA and showed increased C6
   alcohols. 1103P enhanced the linalool from Merlot berry, with marked
   upregulation of VvLinNer1. Conversely, rootstocks increased the total
   aroma content of Marselan berry, verified by the related expression
   levels of volatile-related genes. For Marselan berry, 5BB and 1103P
   upregulated five VvGTs and nine genes from the LOX and MEP pathway.
   1103P increased the contents of C6 alcohols, C6 aldehydes, and
   citronellol from Marselan berry. Compared to 5BB and SO4, rootstock
   1103P provided berries of better quality and richer aroma volatiles to
   Merlot and Marselan, while all three of the rootstocks had a significant
   effect on scion-rootstocks.},

Abstract = {The narrow genetic base of modern cultivars is becoming a key bottleneck
   for crop improvement and the use of wild relatives is an appropriate
   approach to improve the genetic diversity of crops to manage the
   sustainable production under different abiotic and biotic constraints.
   In Pakistan, wild germplasm of grapevine viz Dakh, Toran, and Zarishk
   belong to Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris and Fatati belong to Vitis
   vinifera subsp. sativa is naturally present in humid and sub-humid areas
   of mountainous and sub-mountainous regions and showed varying level of
   tolerance against drought stress but have not been evaluated as
   rootstock. In this study, different tolerant behavior of wild grapevines
   as rootstock in grafted scion varieties were explored under different
   levels of PEG-6000 mediated drought stress i.e., -4.00, -6.00, and -8.00
   bars. In response to drought stress, wild grapevines evoked several
   non-enzymatic and enzymatic activities. Among non-enzymatic activities,
   total chlorophyll contents of commercial varieties were sustained at
   higher level when grafted on wild grapevines Dakh and Fatati which
   subsequently reduced the damage of cell membrane via MDA. Whereas, to
   cope the membranous damage due to excessive cellular generation of ROS,
   wild grapevines triggered the enhanced activities of SOD to dismutase
   the free oxygen radicals into H2O2, then CAT enzyme convert the H2O2
   into water molecules. Higher accumulation of ROS in commercial scion
   varieties were also coped by wild grapevines Dakh and Fatati through the
   upregulation of POD and APX enzymes activities. Based on these enzymatic
   and non-enzymatic indices, biplot and cluster analysis classified the
   wild grapevines as rootstock into three distinct categories comprises on
   relatively tolerant i.e., Dakh (Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris) and
   Fatati (Vitis vinifera subsp. sativa), moderate tolerant i.e., Toran
   (Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris) and relatively susceptible category
   i.e., Zarishk (Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris).},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND `Vegetative' and `generative' tomato rootstock types have
   been proposed based on their different effects on tomato scion growth
   performance; however, their impacts on fruit quality have not been
   characterized. No study has been conducted in which the effects of
   rootstock on grape tomato quality attributes were assessed using sensory
   and instrumental methods of evaluation. Here, we conducted two
   experiments to examine the influence of `DR0141TX', `Estamino', and
   `Multifort' rootstocks (vegetative, generative, and uncharacterized,
   respectively) on fruit quality properties of determinate and
   indeterminate grape tomato scions under organic production in high
   tunnels, including color, size, firmness, dry matter content, soluble
   solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), pH, and consumer sensory
   attributes. RESULTS In both experiments, grafting `Sweet Hearts'
   indeterminate grape tomato onto `DR0141TX', `Estamino', or `Multifort'
   increased fruit size and led to negligible effects on sensory attributes
   and instrumental measurements of fruit quality attributes. For `BHN
   1022' determinate grape tomato, rootstocks did not exhibit any major
   impact on fruit quality attributes in Experiment 1. However, fruit
   quality was compromised by grafting per se and rootstocks, especially
   `Multifort', in Experiment 2, as reflected by reduced SSC, TA, and
   SSC/TA and lower scores for overall appearance, overall acceptability,
   tomato flavor, overall texture, and sweetness. CONCLUSION In general,
   `vegetative' and `generative' rootstocks showed comparable effects on
   sensory evaluations and instrumental measurements of grape tomato
   quality attributes for both indeterminate and determinate scions. More
   research is needed to better characterize rootstock effects on fruit
   quality, including the flavor-related compounds under different growing
   conditions. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine the grafting success and carbohydrate
   distributions for newly registered foxy grape varieties grafted on
   different American grapes and grown in humid conditions in the Black Sea
   Region of Turkey. In the study, `Rizessi', `celiksu', `ulkemiz',
   `Rizellim', and `Rizpem' foxy grape varieties were grafted on 140Ru,
   SO4, and 110R American rootstocks. The graft success, growth, and
   development characteristics were determined, and carbohydrate
   accumulations and distributions at the graft area, under the graft area
   (rootstock), and above the graft area (scion) of the grafted grapevines
   in the dormant period were also determined. The highest graft success
   rate was 100.00\% in the combinations of `Rizessi'/SO4, `Rizellim'/SO4,
   `Rizpem'/SO4, `Rizellim'/110R, and `Rizpem'/110R. The percentage of vine
   saplings ranged from 86.00\% ('Rizellim'/SO4) to 27.14\%
   ('Rizpem'/140Ru). Regarding carbohydrate distribution, the
   `Rizessi'/140Ru, `Rizessi'/SO4, `Rizessi'/110R, `celiksu'/SO4,
   `celiksu'/110R, `ulkemiz'/SO4, `Rizellim'/140Ru, `Rizellim'/SO4,

   distribution. The highest total carbohydrate accumulation (100.41 mg
   center dot L-1) was detected in the root region of the `ulkemiz'/SO4
   combination. On the other hand, vine sapling rate enhanced as
   carbohydrate accumulation increased in the grafting area. The SO4
   American rootstock was found to be more successful than the others.},

Abstract = {Recently, so-called ``vegetative `` and ``generative `` rootstocks have
   been identified by seed companies as rootstock types that have different
   impacts on tomato scions. In this experiment of grafted grape tomato
   production in an organically man-aged high tunnel system, we
   characterized the effects of vegetative and generative rootstock
   cultivars on tomato yield components and fruit mineral contents. Grape
   to-mato scions `BHN 1022' (determinate) and `Sweet Hearts'
   (indeterminate) were grafted onto `DR0141TX' (vegetative), `Estamino'
   (generative), and `Multifort' (non -characterized) rootstocks with
   self-and nongrafted scions as controls. Experiments were conducted twice
   with different transplanting dates (Expt. 1: 31 Jan. vs. Expt. 2: 9
   Mar.) in 2018. No rootstock by scion interaction effects on whole-season
   fruit yield components were observed, indicating similar responses of
   determinate and indeterminate grape tomato scions to all rootstocks
   tested. For Expt. 1, the three rootstocks increased marketable fruit
   number, marketable yield, and total yield by 23.3\%, 37.9\%, and 34.4\%
   on average, respectively, compared with the self-and nongrafted
   controls, primarily due to improved productivity during the peak and
   late harvest periods. For Expt. 2, the rootstocks did not significantly
   benefit any whole-season yield components. `DR0141TX' and `Multifort'
   increased stem diameter in both ex-periments, whereas `Estamino' only
   increased stem diameter in Expt. 2 relative to the nongrafted controls.
   Consistent increase in aboveground dry biomass of rootstock treatments
   at crop termination in Expt. 1 corresponded to the greater yield of
   root-stock-grafted plants in that experiment. All rootstocks in both
   experiments consistently increased fruit P, K, Ca, Zn, and Fe contents
   on a dry weight basis at peak harvest regardless of the tomato scion
   used. Despite a relatively low level of root-knot nematode infestation,
   plants grafted with `DR0141TX' or `Estamino' tended to have lower root
   galling index ratings than scion controls and `Multifort'-grafted
   plants, which was more evident in Expt. 1. Given the different
   environmental conditions during the tomato production period between the
   two experiments conducted in high tunnels, our findings highlight the
   important influence of production environment on grafted tomato
   performance. This study on grafted grape tomatoes in high tunnel organic
   production systems also demonstrated that so-called ``vegetative `` and
   ``generative `` rootstocks had similar impacts on tomato scion yield
   components and fruit mineral contents.},

Abstract = {Grapevine grafting is an essential practice in viticulture and over the
   years, various bench grafting techniques have been developed to
   mechanize the nursery process and to increase the yield in number of
   viable cuttings. Bench grafting is a fundamental nursery practice that
   can potentially affect the quality of propagation material also in young
   decline associated to grapevine trunk diseases and has been recently
   reported to influence leaf symptoms development associated with diseases
   of Esca complex. The study aimed to investigate how three bench grafting
   methods {[}i.e., (i) Omega graft as mechanical technique, (ii) Whip and
   Tongue graft as manual technique and (iii) Full Cleft graft as
   semi-mechanical technique] can influence these phenomena. Specifically,
   the different methods were compared for their effect on the anatomical
   development of the grafting point and the functionality of the xylem,
   also considering two factors: the grapevine cultivar (Cabernet
   Sauvignon, Glera and Teroldego) and the scion/rootstock diameter (thin
   and large). Observations by light microscopy on the anatomical evolution
   and measurements on the xylem morphology and hydraulic traits were
   correlated with the grafting methods and the investigated varieties. The
   anatomical observations revealed that the mechanical (Omega) and
   semi-mechanical (Full Cleft) grafting methods have a faster callusing
   response while the manual technique (Whip and Tongue) has a slower but
   greater vascularization of the differentiated callus. Significant
   differences between cultivars and/or grafting types were also detected
   in necrotic area on the grafted tissues. Statistical analysis of the
   grapevine vessels suggested differences in xylem parameters between
   cultivars, while grafting type had no significant effects. On the other
   hand, the grafting type significantly affected the intrinsic growth
   rate. The study confirms the potential incidence of lesions and
   dysfunctionalities correlated with the grafting method applied, which
   can potentially induce grafted vine declines in vineyards due to the
   necrotic area detected on the grafted tissues.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Drought, one of the most severe and complex abiotic stresses, is
   increasingly occurring due to global climate change and adversely
   affects plant growth and yield. Grafting is a proven and effective tool
   to enhance plant drought resistance ability by regulating their
   physiological and molecular processes. In this review, we have
   summarized the current understanding, mechanisms, and perspectives of
   the drought stress resistance of grafted plants. Plants resist drought
   through adaptive changes in their root, stem, and leaf morphology and
   structure, stomatal closure modulation to reduce transpiration,
   activating osmoregulation, enhancing antioxidant systems, and regulating
   phytohormones and gene expression changes. Additionally, the mRNAs,
   miRNAs and peptides crossing the grafted healing sites also confer
   drought resistance. However, the interaction between phytohormones,
   establishment of the scion-rootstock communication through genetic
   materials to enhance drought resistance is becoming a hot research
   topic. Therefore, our review provides not only physiological evidences
   for selecting drought-resistant rootstocks or scions, but also a clear
   understanding of the potential molecular effects to enhance drought
   resistance using grafted plants.},

Abstract = {Background The kinetic parameters of peach rootstock are a major factor
   contributing to its nitrogen (N) uptake efficiency, which directly
   affects the yield and quality parameters. However, the impact of
   grafting on N kinetic parameters is not sufficiently known as rootstocks
   are grafted with other scion cultivars before being transplanted to the
   field. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate whether the
   grafting of `Okinawa' rootstock with the scion cultivar `Chimarrita' can
   alter the kinetic parameters related to N uptake. Results The plants
   were acclimatized in Hoagland solution for 21 days and, sequentially,
   were tested to assess the depletion of the internal reserves at 15 and
   30 days in CaSO4 solution. Morphological and physiological parameters
   were evaluated, and kinetic parameters were calculated. The depletion
   period for to reach the minimum concentration (C-min) of NO3- and NH4+
   in the plant was 62 h and 56 h, respectively. The optimal time for
   internal reserve depletion for `Okinawa' rootstock with and without the
   `Chimarrita' scion was 30 days. Conclusion `Okinawa' rootstock grafted
   with `Chimarrita' scion cultivar was more efficient in NO3- and NH4+

Abstract = {In recent years, Colomerus vitis has caused serious economic losses due
   to reduced grape production in Xinjiang (northwest China). Several
   rootstock varieties have been reported to improve the resistance of
   Cabernet Sauvignon to Colomerus vitis. This study explored the influence
   of Cabernet Sauvignon with different rootstocks on the resistance to
   Colomerus vitis. In particular, Cabernet Sauvignon/Cabernet Sauvignon
   (CS/CS) was selected as the control, and Cabernet Sauvignon grafted with
   five resistant rootstocks (3309C, 1103P, 140R, SO4, and 5C) was employed
   as the treatment. The infestation rate and injury index of Colomerus
   vitis to grapevines was investigated, and insect-resistant types of
   grapevines with different rootstocks were determined. The resveratrol
   (Res) content, the gene expression of resveratrol synthase (RS), and the
   activities of peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), catalase
   (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the leaves of each rootstock
   grapevine were measured. The activity of the four enzymes and the
   content of Res were negatively correlated with the injury index. The
   results revealed the ability of the rootstock to improve the resistance
   of grapevines to Colomerus vitis by increasing the enzyme activity or
   Res content. In particular, 140R, SO4, and 5C rootstocks can be employed
   as rootstocks of the `Cabernet Sauvignon' grapevine with resistance to
   Colomerus vitis. The contents of Res and the four resistance enzymes
   studied here can be used as indexes to evaluate the insect resistance of
   rootstock-scion combinations.},

Abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB), which is believed to be caused by the
   phloem-restricted bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas),
   has decimated Florida's citrus production. Grapefruit production has
   declined 75\%, mandarin 78\%, and sweet orange 52\% due to the high
   sensitivity of commercial scions and rootstocks to the disease. New
   combinations of scions and hybrid rootstocks may provide better
   performance than current commercial selections for Florida's fresh
   citrus production, particularly in the Indian River District. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate and compare University of
   Florida rootstocks and other recently released rootstocks grafted with
   grapefruit, navel orange, and mandarin scions by measuring tree growth
   and HLB tolerance. Three independent large-scale field trials were
   established in September 2019 in Fort Pierce, FL, USA. Trial 1 (T1)
   included 36 rootstocks with `Ray Ruby' grapefruit as the scion; Trials 2
   and 3 (T2 and T3, respectively) included 30 rootstocks with `Glenn'
   navel orange F-56-11 and `UF-950' mandarin as the scion, respectively.
   Tree canopy volume, trunk diameter, CLas titer, HLB severity index, and
   leaf nutrient concentrations were evaluated during 2020 and 2021.
   Significant differences among rootstock-scion combinations were found in
   each trial for most of the assessed traits. In T2, UFR-15 consistently
   developed the largest `Ray Ruby' grapefruit trees during both years. In
   T3, `Glenn' navel orange F-56-11 trees were larger on C-22, and US-802.
   Similarly, US-802 and US-942 generated the largest `UF-950' mandarin
   trees. Overall, trees had optimum levels of macro- and micronutrients
   except for calcium. CLas infection and HLB visual index varied among
   scion-rootstock combinations, especially during the first year of growth
   when intensive flushing was produced. Generally, trees grew vigorously
   with WGFT+50-7 and Willits inducing the lowest HLB symptoms in all
   evaluations. Production and fruit quality need to be evaluated to
   determine the suitability of potential scion-rootstock combinations that
   can confer consistent economical and biological advantages under the
   current HLB scenario in the Indian River District.},

   the microbiological quality of the soil and grapevine rootstock genotype

   rootstocks heterografted with the same scion were grown in two vineyard
   soils differing in microbial composition and activities. After 4 months,
   culture-dependent approaches and amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S
   rRNA gene and fungal ITS were performed on roots, rhizosphere and bulk
   soil samples. The root mycorrhizal colonization and number of cultivable
   microorganisms in the rhizosphere compartment of both genotypes were
   clearly influenced by the soil status. The fungal diversity and richness
   were dependent on the soil status and the rootstock, whereas bacterial
   richness was affected by the genotype only. Fungal genera associated
   with grapevine diseases were more abundant in declining soil and related
   root samples. The rootstock affected the compartmentalization of
   microbial communities, underscoring its influence on microorganism
   selection. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the
   presence of predominant root-associated bacteria. These results

Title = {How Rootstocks Impact the Scion Vigour and Vine Performance of Vitis
   vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo},

Abstract = {Background and Aim. The genetically determined characteristics of
   grapevine rootstocks are important factors that affect scion
   performance. This 3 years' field study aimed to characterize the
   influence of four well-established 30-year-old rootstocks (110 Richter,
   1103 Paulsen, 41B, and 161-49Couderc) on the Tempranillo cultivar in the
   semiarid wine growing region of D.O.Ca. Rioja, North-Eastern Spain.
   Methods and Results. Nutrient concentrations of mineral elements at
   flowering and veraison were determined in the vines, jointly with
   grapevine-water status, gas exchange, vine vigour, and chlorophyll
   content. Moreover, grapevine yield and grape quality were determined at
   harvest. The least vigorous rootstocks (41B, 161-49C) conferred drought
   adaptability traits by increasing water use efficiency (WUE) and
   decreasing whole-plant water conductance per unit leaf area (K-plant)
   compared to the more vigorous rootstocks (1103-P, 110-R). In contrast,
   the more vigorous rootstocks increased water transport capacity, which
   led to higher plant performance and nutrient uptake efficiency. At
   flowering, 1103-P and to a lesser extent, 110-R were most efficient at
   taking up nutrients, while 161-49C had the lowest concentrations for
   most nutrients. At veraison, 41B exhibited closer behaviour to 110-R
   than 161-49C, while 1103-P and 161-49C remained the most differentiated
   rootstocks, with higher and lower nutrient uptake, respectively. In
   addition, compared to the more vigorous rootstocks, the yield was up to
   1.6 kg lower for the less vigorous rootstocks but the grape composition
   was improved. Notably, 161-49C led to higher total soluble solids, total
   acidity, and polyphenol content. Conclusions. Overall, grafting onto
   specific rootstocks represents a strategy to confer differential
   regulation of grapevine water-saving strategies, yield, berry quality,
   and nutrient uptake potential. Significance of the Study. This
   information may be useful for growers seeking to develop a site-specific
   selection of rootstocks for the grafted Tempranillo cv.},

   However, seedling growth and quality is key for plant breeding programs
   initiating thousands of unique seedlings each year. To investigate
   treatments for their impact on diverse interspecific cold-hardy
   grapevines, seedlings were grown under greenhouse conditions. Four weeks
   after transplant, seedlings were cut back to one true node (CUT), leaf
   thinned (LT), or left as untreated control vines (Control). Eight weeks
   after treatment, plants were analyzed for total node number, periderm
   encompassed nodes, lateral shoot number, and total number of base stems.
   Control and LT vines had more periderm encompassed nodes and total nodes

Journal = {PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {325},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accessing freshwater resources for agriculture becomes more complex due
   to increasing demands and declining water quality. Alternative water
   sources, such as saline water, require ad hoc solutions. Therefore,
   understanding roots' response to saline water is crucial for future
   agriculture. We examined the response of three grapevine rootstocks
   (Paulsen 1103, Richter 110 and SO4) to salt stress. The rootstocks were
   subjected to two salinity treatments: 10 mM and 30 mM NaCl (EC = 2 and 4
   ds/m, respectively). Root and shoot samples were taken at the end of the
   experiment for morphologic and ionomic analyses. The specific root area
   (SRA) increased in response to salinity for all three rootstocks due to
   root tissue density and average root diameter reductions. Salinity also
   led to increased root Na+ and Cl- contents and reduced root K+/Na+
   ratio, parallel to increased leaf Cl- but not Na+ contents. SO4 showed
   improved chloride and sodium exclusion, concomitant with its highest
   SRA, resulting from the increase in its thin roots' contribution to the
   total root system surface area. We suggest that enhanced SRA combined
   with decreased root tissue density and diameter may improve grapevines'
   salt exclusion by less salt uptake from the soil.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Previous studies of tomato rootstock effects on fruit quality have
   yielded mixed results, and few attempts have been made to systematically
   examine the association between rootstock characteristics and tomato
   fruit quality. In this study, grape tomato ('BHN 1022') and beefsteak
   tomato ('Skyway') were grafted onto four rootstocks {[}'Estamino'
   (vigorous and ``generative{''}), `DR0141TX' (vigorous and
   ``vegetative{''}), `RST-04-106-T' (uncharacterized), and `SHIELD RZ F1
   (61-802)' (mid-vigor, uncharacterized)] and compared to non-grafted
   scion controls for two growing seasons (Spring and Fall in Florida) in
   organically managed high tunnels. In both seasons and for both scions,
   the two vigorous rootstocks, regardless of their designation as
   ``vegetative{''} ('DR0141TX') or ``generative{''} ('Estamino'),
   exhibited negative impacts on dry matter content, soluble solids content
   (SSC), SSC/titratable acidity (TA), lycopene, and ascorbic acid
   contents. Similar effects on fruit dry matter content and SSC were also
   observed with the `RST-04-106-T' rootstock, although little to no change
   was seen with grafting onto `SHIELD RZ F1 (61-802)'. Further studies are
   needed to elucidate the impact of rootstock vigor on tomato volatile
   profiles and consumer sensory acceptability in order to better determine
   whether any of the documented effects are of practical importance. On
   the other hand, the evident effects of scion cultivar and planting
   season on fruit quality were observed in most of the measurements. The
   scion by rootstock interaction affected fruit length, firmness, pH, and
   total phenolic content, while the planting season by rootstock
   interaction impacted fruit firmness, pH, total antioxidant capacity, and
   ascorbic acid and lycopene contents. The multivariate separation pattern
   of planting season, scion, and rootstock treatments as revealed by the
   canonical discriminant analysis further indicated that the influence of
   scion cultivar and planting season on tomato fruit quality could be much
   more pronounced than the rootstock effects. The fruit color (C{*} and H
   degrees), length and width, SSC, pH, total antioxidant capacity,
   ascorbic acid, and lycopene contents were the main attributes
   distinguishing different scion-planting season groups.},

Abstract = {The appropriate selection of rootstock-scion combinations to improve
   yield and fully realize grafting benefits requires an in-depth
   understanding of rootstock-scion synergy. Toward this end, we grafted
   two determinate-type scions {[}grape tomato ('BHN 1022') and beefsteak
   tomato ('Skyway')] onto four rootstocks with different characteristics
   to examine plant growth, yield performance, biomass production, and
   fruit mineral nutrient composition. The study was conducted during two
   growing seasons (spring and fall plantings in Florida) under organic
   production in high tunnels with the non-grafted scions as controls.
   Rootstocks had previously been designated as either ``generative{''}
   ('Estamino') or ``vegetative{''} ('DR0141TX') by some commercial
   suppliers or had not been characterized {[}'RST-04-106-T' and `SHIELD RZ
   F1 (61-802)']. Also, `Estamino', `DR0141TX', and `RST-04-106-T' had been
   described as more vigorous than `SHIELD RZ F1 (61-802)'. In both
   planting seasons (with low levels of soilborne disease pressure), the
   ``vegetative{''} and ``generative{''} rootstocks increased marketable
   and total fruit yields for both scions except for the beefsteak tomato
   grafted with the ``vegetative{''} rootstock in fall planting. Positive
   effects of `RST-04-106-T' on fruit yield varied with scions and planting
   seasons, and were most manifested when grafted with the beefsteak tomato
   scion in fall planting. `SHIELD RZ F1 (61-802)' led to similar yields as
   the non-grafted controls except for grafting with the grape tomato scion
   in fall planting. For vegetative and fruit biomass, both the
   ``vegetative{''} and ``generative{''} rootstocks had positive impacts
   except for the beefsteak tomato in fall planting. For fruit mineral
   composition, the ``vegetative{''} and ``generative{''} rootstocks, both
   highly vigorous, consistently elevated fruit P, K, Ca, Zn, and Fe
   contents on a dry weight basis, whereas the other rootstocks did not.
   Overall, although the more vigorous rootstocks enhanced tomato plant
   productivity and fruit minerals, the evidence presented here does not
   support the suggestion that the so-called ``vegetative{''} and
   ``generative{''} rootstocks have different impacts on tomato scion
   yield, biomass production, or fruit mineral contents. More studies with
   different production systems and environmental conditions as well as
   contrasting scion genotypes are needed to further categorize the impacts
   of rootstocks with different vigor and other characteristics on plant
   biomass production and their implications on fruit yield development.},

   growth (simulated late spring frost). Leaf gas exchange, pruning cane
   weight, vine yield, and fruit maturity data were collected each year.
   Bud treatment or rootstock did not influence leaf gas exchange. Cane
   weight and yield data were greater for shoots grown from primary bud
   shoots, and rootstock 1103P. In addition, berries grown from primary
   buds and 1103P rootstocks were more mature compared to fruits from

Abstract = {Annual rings from 30 year old vines in a California rootstock trial were
   measured to determine the effects of 15 different rootstocks on
   Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon scions. Viticultural traits measuring
   vegetative growth, yield, berry quality, and nutrient uptake were
   collected at the beginning (1995 to 1999) and end (2017 to 2020) of the
   lifetime of a vineyard initially planted in 1991 and removed in 2021.
   X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) was used to measure ring widths in 103
   vines. Ring width was modeled as a function of ring number using a
   negative exponential model. Early and late wood ring widths, cambium
   width, and scion trunk radius were correlated with 27 traits. Modeling
   of annual ring width shows that scions alter the width of the first
   rings but that rootstocks alter the decay of later rings, consistently
   shortening ring width throughout the lifetime of the vine. Ravaz index,
   juice pH, photosynthetic assimilation and transpiration rates, and
   instantaneous water use efficiency are correlated with scion trunk
   radius. Ultimately, our research indicates that rootstocks modulate
   secondary growth over years, altering physiology and agronomic traits.
   Rootstocks act in similar but distinct ways from climate to modulate
   ring width, which borrowing techniques from dendrochronology, can be
   used to monitor both genetic and environmental effects in woody
   perennial crop species.},

Abstract = {Litchi is an important commercial fruit crop widely grown in the world.
   Graft incompatibility between rootstocks and scions is a major
   constraint for large-scale cultivation of litchi orchards,
   popularization of new and excellent litchi varieties, and associated
   industrial development. Further, the genetic mechanism of graft
   incompatibility is still unclear in litchi. To reduce the
   incompatibility problems, this study investigated metabolic and
   transcriptomic differences between graft compatible and incompatible
   rootstock-scion combinations of litchi. The result of metabolomics
   analysis showed that incompatible rootstock-scion interaction modified
   the profiles of several metabolic substances. However, various compounds
   of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and lignin predominantly exhibited
   significantly altered abundance in graft incompatible combinations.
   Transcriptome analysis identified that graft incompatibility induces
   dynamic gene differences. The majority of these differentially expressed
   genes were enriched in biosynthetic pathways of phenylpropanoids. The
   differential expressions of genes in these pathways could be linked to
   the differential abundance levels of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and
   lignin compounds. Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses
   revealed a strong relationship between differential genes and
   differential metabolites identified in this study. In addition,
   identified hub genes and metabolites were closely associated with graft
   incompatibility of litchi. This study characterized the abundance of
   metabolites and genes in graft incompatible combinations and further
   discussed the genetic mechanism of graft incompatibility in litchi. Our

Title = {Multiplication, Phenological Period and Growth Vigor of Thirty-One
   Grapevine Rootstocks and the Role of Parentage in Vigor Heredity},

Abstract = {Knowledge about the growth vigor of grapevine rootstocks is required for
   scion-based rootstock selection and rootstock breeding. We performed
   this trial aiming to evaluate the multiplication and growth vigor of
   several rootstocks. Thirty-one rootstock genotypes were compared on
   their multiplication characteristics, phenological periods, and growth
   indicators across three consecutive seasons. The results suggested that
   the cuttings of most rootstocks had callus-forming indices (CFIs) over
   0.5 except for `188-08' (0.28). The rooting rate of `420A' was 5\%,
   while that of the rest of the rootstocks was greater than 48\%. The
   internode lengths of the one-year-old vines were positively correlated
   with those (as well as cane lengths and pruning weights) of the adult
   vines. These rootstocks were grouped into three clusters based on the
   growth measurements across three seasons. Eight combinations of genetic
   backgrounds showed various effects on the growth indicators. The
   high-vigor cluster includes `1103P', `5BB', `225Ru', etc.; the
   medium-vigor cluster includes `Dogridge', `101-14M', `Fercal', etc.; and
   the low-vigor cluster includes `Gloire', `3309C', `Ganzin1', etc. The
   Vitis berlandieri parentage showed a higher vigor heredity, while the V.
   riparia showed a lower vigor heredity. These findings would contribute
   to rootstock nursery construction and provide references for vigor-based
   rootstock selection for grafts and parent selection for rootstock
   breeding.},

Abstract = {Grapevine rootstocks may supply water to the scion according to the
   transpiration demand, thus modulating plant responses to water deficit,
   but the scion variety can alter these responses, as well. The rootstock
   genotypes' effect on the scion physiological response, aquaporin
   expression, and hormone concentrations in the xylem and the leaf was
   assessed under well watered (WW) and water stress (WS) conditions. Under
   WW, vines grafted onto 1103P and R110 rootstocks (the more vigorous and
   drought-tolerant) showed higher photosynthesis (A(N)), stomatal
   conductance (g(s)), and hydraulic conductance (Kh(plant)) compared with
   the less vigorous and drought-sensitive rootstock (161-49C), while under
   WS, there were hardly any differences between vines depending on the
   rootstock grafted. Besides, stomatal traits were affected by drought,
   which was related to g(s), but not by the rootstock. Under WS
   conditions, all VvPIP and VvTIP aquaporins were up-regulated in the
   vines grafted onto 1103P and down-regulated in the ones grafted onto
   161-49C. The 1103P capability to tolerate drought was enhanced by the
   up-regulation of all VvPIP and VvTIP aquaporins, lower ABA synthesis,
   and higher ACC/ABA ratios in leaves during WS compared with 161-49C. It
   was concluded that, under WW conditions, transpiration and stomatal
   control were rootstock-dependent. However, under WS conditions,
   alterations in the molecular components of water transport and hormone
   concentration of the scion resulted in similar gas exchange values in
   the studied scions grafted onto different rootstocks.},

Abstract = {Agricultural bioinoculants containing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   represent a potential opportunity to reduce the dependence of grapevines
   (Vitis) on agrochemicals. This field study assessed the ability of four
   commercial bioinoculants to colonize grapevine roots and their effects
   on petiole nutrient concentration, berry composition, and root
   morphology of `Pinot noir' (Vitis vinifera) grafted onto rootstock
   `Couderc 3309' (Vitis riparia x Vitis rupestris) and `Riesling' (V.
   vinifera) grafted onto `Couderc 3309' and Selection Oppenheim four
   (Vitis berlandieri x V. riparia). Three bioinoculants increased root
   mycorrhizal colonization; however, regardless of the treatment,
   mycorrhizal fungal structures were enhanced. Grapevine petiole nutrient
   concentration was improved by bioinoculants. Root diameter, root length
   density, and specific root length increased with greater mycorrhizal
   root colonization. Using bioinoculants to reduce chemical fertilizers
   may be a good strategy to improve grapevine productivity and health in
   cool climates; however, the impact of mycorrhizal bioinoculants in the
   vineyard may differ among scion-rootstocks, edaphoclimatic conditions,
   and vineyard soil microbiomes.},

Title = {Physiological and Transcriptomic Evaluation of Drought Effect on
   Own-Rooted and Grafted Grapevine Rootstock (1103P and 101-14MGt)},

Abstract = {Grapevines worldwide are grafted onto Vitis spp. rootstocks in order to
   improve their tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, the
   response of vines to drought is the result of the interaction between
   the scion variety and the rootstock genotype. In this work, the
   responses of genotypes to drought were evaluated on 1103P and 101-14MGt
   plants, own-rooted and grafted with Cabernet Sauvignon, in three
   different water deficit conditions (80, 50, and 20\% soil water content,
   SWC). Gas exchange parameters, stem water potential, root and leaf ABA
   content, and root and leaf transcriptomic response were investigated.
   Under well-watered conditions, gas exchange and stem water potential
   were mainly affected by the grafting condition, whereas under sever
   water deficit they were affected by the rootstock genotype. Under severe
   stress conditions (20\% SWC), 1103P showed an ``avoidance{''} behavior.
   It reduced stomatal conductance, inhibited photosynthesis, increased ABA
   content in the roots, and closed the stomata. The 101-14MGt maintained a
   high photosynthetic rate, limiting the reduction of soil water
   potential. This behavior results in a ``tolerance{''} strategy. An
   analysis of the transcriptome showed that most of the differentially
   expressed genes were detected at 20\% SWC, and more significantly in
   roots than in leaves. A core set of genes has been highlighted on the
   roots as being related to the root response to drought that are not
   affected by genotype nor grafting. Genes specifically regulated by
   grafting and genes specifically regulated by genotype under drought
   conditions have been identified as well. The 1103P, more than the
   101-14MGt, regulated a high number of genes in both own-rooted and
   grafted conditions. This different regulation revealed that 1103P
   rootstock readily perceived the water scarcity and rapidly faced the
   stress, in agreement with its avoidance strategy.},

Abstract = {Sweet cherry is mainly cultivated in arid and semi-arid areas. In the
   last decade, these areas have experienced a dramatic reduction in
   rainfall, which has resulted in water shortage for sweet cherry. The use
   of specific root-stock and scion combinations could help improve the
   tolerance of plants to water shortage events. This study reports on the
   influence of rootstocks on whole-plant performance under water deficit
   as detected by hydraulic sensitivity, root hydraulic conductivity (Lp),
   water use efficiency and sugar content. Four Prunus rootstocks/scion
   combinations -'Bing/Colt', `Lapins/Colt', `Bing/Mx60', `Lapins/Mx60',
   and two self-rooted rootstocks Colt and Maxma 60 -were acclimated for 30
   days and then exposed to well-watered (WW) and water deficit (WD)
   conditions for 36 days. Whole-plant transpiration and growth were both
   influenced by WD, and two groups were identified based on responses:
   `Bing/Colt', `Bing/Mx60' and `Mx60' had an early reduction (conservative
   strategy), whereas `Lapins/Mx60', `Lapins/Colt' and `Colt' had late
   reduction (productive strategy) in transpi-ration as WD increased. Among
   the combinations, `Lapins/Colt' and `Colt' showed a remarkable growth
   response to the WD being less affected in shoot and root biomass. The
   `Colt' rootstock maintained a higher psi gs50 (near-isohydric behavior)
   than combinations using the `Mx60' rootstock (near anisohydric
   behavior). The relationship between Lp and the variation of psi
   pre-dawn-psi midday showed differences among rootstock/scion
   combinations, and under WD condition the reduction in Lp induced by WD
   affected the whole-plant WUE of combinations differ-ently. Sucrose and
   sorbitol content in leaves and roots of WD-tolerant combinations such as
   `Colt' and `Lapins/ Colt', showed a remarkable increase under WD
   condition. Our finding highlights the importance of the specific
   interaction between rootstock and scion, suggesting that combinations
   characterized by a higher water uptake capacity under conditions of
   lower water availability would be sustainable under minimal to moderate
   water deficit.},
