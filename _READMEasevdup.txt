This a subset of files in vin/general/docs/manuscripts/asevdiversity that I put together when working with Christophe Rouleau-Desrochers on figures. 

I am updating the ms there, but using this for sharing files and tracking issues.

Updated 6 June 2024:
Copied over rootstockxscion/ folder to vin repo and some (but not all) figures in figures folder.
